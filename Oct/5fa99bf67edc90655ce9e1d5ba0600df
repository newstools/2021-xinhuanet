BERLIN, Oct. 25 (Xinhua) -- Sentiment in the German economy deteriorated for the fourth consecutive month as the corresponding ifo business climate index fell to 97.7 points in October, the ifo Institute for Economic Research announced on Monday. "Supply problems are giving headaches to businesses," said Clemens Fuest, president of the Munich-based institute, in a statement, stressing that "sand in the wheels of the German economy is hampering the recovery." Capacity utilization in German manufacturing dropped by 2.1 percentage points to 84.7 percent, according to the ifo Institute. The overall index for the trade sector even fell significantly as supply bottlenecks were "weighing on sentiment." The economic recovery in Germany would still be slowed by the effects of the pandemic and supply bottlenecks in winter 2021/2022. Leading economic research institutes recently lowered their joint expectations for the country's GDP growth in 2021 from 3.7 percent to 2.4 percent. The country's booming construction sector was hardly affected by the shortages and business sentiment improved further. Companies' assessments of their current situation were even "a little better" and the expectations index rose for the sixth month in a row. The index is based on around 9,000 monthly responses from businesses in manufacturing, the service sector, trade and construction. Companies are asked for their assessment of the current business situation as well as their expectations for the next six months. Enditem
