The top ten trading partners of the manufacturing hub, which borders Hong Kong, contributed to 77.3 percent of the total trade, with trade with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the European Union seeing double-digit growth. Privately-owned businesses contributed to 1.54 trillion yuan of the trade. It is up 17 percent year on year, accounting for over 61 percent of the total trade, said the customs. The proportion rose by one percentage point from a year ago. Mechanical and electrical products accounted for nearly 80 percent of both exports and imports during the nine months.  ■
