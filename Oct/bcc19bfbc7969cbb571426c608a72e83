SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 27 (Xinhua) -- Apple on Wednesday announced it has more than doubled the number of suppliers committed to using 100 percent clean energy over the last year, accelerating progress toward its 2030 goal to be carbon neutral across its supply chain and products. In total, 175 Apple suppliers will transition to using renewable energy, and the company and its suppliers will bring online more than 9 gigawatts of clean power around the world. These actions will avoid over 18 million metric tons of CO2 emissions annually - the equivalent of taking over 4 million cars off the road each year, the company said. The company added 10 new projects for its first-of-a-kind Power for Impact initiative to bring clean energy solutions to communities around the world. "The new projects we're sharing will help communities by developing new local renewable projects, creating a healthier and more equitable world while advancing the fight against climate change," said Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of environment, policy, and social initiatives. The company announced last year that every device it sold will have a net-zero climate impact by 2030. In total, Apple has reduced its carbon emissions by 40 percent over the past five years. "Every company should be a part of the fight against climate change, and together with our suppliers and local communities, we're demonstrating all of the opportunity and equity green innovation can bring," said Apple's CEO Tim Cook. In the United States, 19 suppliers in Apple's Supplier Clean Energy Program are scaling their use of renewable energy across their Apple operations, often going beyond their business with Apple. In Europe, 19 suppliers are now part of the program. In China, 50 suppliers are now part of the program, with many maximizing their use of on-site solutions. In India, Japan, and South Korea, 31 suppliers have joined in the program, according to Apple. Enditem
