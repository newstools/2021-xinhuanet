SYDNEY, Oct. 24 (Xinhua) -- Authorities of Australian state of Victoria outlined on Sunday what life would look like when the state reaches vaccination rates of 80 and 90 percent. Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said there would be a "fundamental change" to health restrictions when the state reaches a 90-percent rate of vaccination, which is predicted to come around Nov. 24. "There will be no caps anywhere." He said. "Masks will only be required in high risk indoor settings, for instance public transport, prisons, hospitals, aged care." He also said that even when this milestone is reached, the "vaccine economy" would remain in place, meaning residents would still need to be fully vaccinated to enter non-essential retail spaces. Victoria recorded 1,935 new locally acquired cases and 11 additional deaths in the 24 hours to midnight Saturday. Despite high case numbers in the state's capital Melbourne, once the state reaches a vaccination rate of 80 percent, residents who were previously locked out of regional Victoria would be allowed to travel anywhere within the state. Andrews announced that 91.2 percent of the state's adult population had received at least one dose of the vaccine, and 73.7 percent were fully vaccinated. Meanwhile as residents in the state of New South Wales (NSW) enjoyed their third weekend since exiting lockdown on Oct. 11, the state recorded 296 new cases and four additional deaths in the 24 hours to 8:00 p.m. Saturday. As of Sunday, 93.3 percent of the NSW's adult population had received at least one dose of the vaccine, and 84.4 percent were fully vaccinated. Once NSW reaches a vaccination rate of 90 percent, predicted for Dec. 1, the majority of restrictions would be lifted. Enditem
