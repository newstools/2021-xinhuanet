BERLIN, Oct. 26 (Xinhua) -- German industry has more than doubled its investment in climate protection over the last ten years, the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) announced on Tuesday. Industrial companies in Germany spent a total of 3.46 billion euros (four billion U.S. dollars) in 2019 on systems which "prevent emissions or enable resources to be used more carefully," Destatis said. Although climate protection's share in the total for investment is still "comparatively small," it climbed to 3.6 percent in 2019, Destatis said. Ten years earlier, the share only amounted to 2.6 percent. "Legal rules and state funding are the likely reasons for that increase. For many years, the government has promoted the transition to production processes using less energy and protecting the climate," Destatis said. Germany is aiming to become climate neutral by 2045, five years earlier than previously planned. The original target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 was increased from 55 percent lower than 1990 levels, to 65 percent lower. To achieve the new targets, the German government adopted an eight-billion-euro emergency climate protection program. This provided funding for coal-free industrial activities, green hydrogen and green steel, among other things. The shift away from carbon-based energy sources was "also reflected in companies' climate protection investments," Destatis noted. More than half of investment went into renewable energy measures in 2019, including wind power and photovoltaic installations. (1 euro = 1.16 U.S. dollar) Enditem
