ZHENGZHOU, Oct. 19 (Xinhua) -- China has revealed the top 100 archaeology findings of the past century as the country celebrates the 100th anniversary of modern archaeology, China Daily reported Tuesday. The findings were made public Monday by the National Cultural Heritage Administration (NCHA) at the opening ceremony of the third Chinese Archaeology Congress in Sanmenxia City, central China's Henan Province, said the newspaper. Excavation of the Yangshao site in the city started in October 1921, marking the beginning of modern archaeology in China.
