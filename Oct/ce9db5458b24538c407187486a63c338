BEIJING, Oct. 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday said that stigmatization of the COVID-19 virus and politicization of origins tracing run counter to the spirit of solidarity against the pandemic. Solidarity and cooperation are the most powerful weapon to fight the pandemic, Xi said, when addressing the 16th Group of 20 (G20) Leaders' Summit via video link. Xi called on the international community to work in concert to confront and defeat the pandemic with a science-based approach. "We need to step up cooperation on prevention, control, diagnosis and treatment, and enhance preparedness for major public health emergencies," he said. The G20 includes the world's major economies and should therefore play a leading role in building consensus, mobilizing resources, and promoting cooperation, he said. Enditem
