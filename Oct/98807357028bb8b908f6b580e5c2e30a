THE HAGUE, Oct. 26 (Xinhua) -- The number of people who tested positive for COVID-19 in the Netherlands rose significantly over the last week, the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) announced on Tuesday. In the week from Oct. 19 to Oct. 26, a total of 38,733 positive test results were counted. This was an increase of 50 percent compared to the previous week. Reported figures increased in all regions and all age groups. Of those aged 12 or over who tested positive for COVID-19 in the Netherlands in recent weeks, 52 percent had not been vaccinated, either partially or fully. Currently, 18.3 percent of Dutch people aged 12 or over are not vaccinated. The number of new patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 rose to 584 in the past week, 34 percent more than the week before. A total of 110 new COVID-19 patients were admitted to intensive care, an increase of 31 percent on the previous week. According to the RIVM, the increase in the number of positive tests appears to be related to the relaxation of COVID-19 measures four weeks ago, combined with the seasonal effect. The Dutch government announced on Monday that it is considering taking new measures to combat the rise in infections. Enditem
