 To Lim Kuang Sia, founder of Malaysian rubber manufacturer Kossan, the China International Import Expo (CIIE) and Chinese market are not something new.  Back in 2019, as then deputy president of the Associated Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Malaysia leading a delegation comprising 120 entrepreneurs and exhibitors, Lim joined the second CIIE. A special pavilion was set up to showcase Malaysia's products.  In a recent interview with Xinhua, Lim termed the CIIE as an impressive platform with fruitful results achieved in trade and investment match-making.  "Products from Malaysia made its way into the Chinese market through the CIIE; hence it has generated strong demand for a spot to join the expo," he said.  Lim said holding the CIIE annually further acts as an affirmation on China's initiative to open up their market.  "For me, the CIIE is an exceptional expo as it is way more than just fostering a much robust domestic China market. At the same time, it creates room and opportunities for global growth by interconnecting the international participants."  Produced by Xinhua Global Service
