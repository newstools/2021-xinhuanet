TRIPOLI, Oct. 21 (Xinhua) -- Libya's Foreign Minister Najla Mangoush on Thursday reaffirmed the Libyan government's rejection to all kinds of foreign interference in the country's internal affairs. "The Government of National Unity of Libya reaffirms its permanent, firm and strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and national unity of Libya, and its complete rejection of foreign interference in Libyan affairs," Mangoush said in a statement at the end of the Libya Stabilization Conference in the Libyan capital Tripoli on Thursday. The Libyan government praised the pivotal role of the United Nations, as well as the efforts of the African Union, the European Union, the Arab League and the neighboring countries, in supporting stability in Libya, the statement said. "Ending the conflict and achieving security and stability in Libya are basis for peace and state-building, a pillar of peaceful coexistence, and a motive for the economy and development," it added. The government also stressed the significance of taking all necessary measures to create proper environment for the upcoming elections. The Libya Stabilization Conference was held on Thursday in Tripoli, and it was the first major international conference held in Libya in over a decade. Libya has been suffering insecurity and chaos since the fall of the late leader Muammar Gaddafi's regime in 2011. The Libyan Government of National Unity was selected in February by the UN-sponsored Libyan Political Dialogue Forum (LPDF), ending years of political division in the country. Libya is expecting to hold general elections on Dec. 24 this year, as endorsed by the LPDF. Enditem
