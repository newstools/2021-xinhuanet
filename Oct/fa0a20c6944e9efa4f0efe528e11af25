WASHINGTON, Oct. 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Wednesday authorized booster doses of the COVID-19 vaccines made by Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. The FDA also authorized "mix and match" booster dose for currently available approved COVID-19 vaccines. A single booster dose of any of the available COVID-19 vaccines may be administered as a "mix and match" booster dose following completion of primary vaccination with a different available COVID-19 vaccine, according to the FDA. The agency approved the use of a single booster dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at least 6 months after completion of the primary shots to people 65 years of age and older, 18 through 64 years of age at high risk of severe COVID-19, and 18 through 64 years of age with frequent institutional or occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2. As for the Johnson & Johnson booster dose, the FDA authorized the use of a single booster dose at least 2 months after completion of the single-dose primary regimen to individuals 18 years of age and older. The decision came after an FDA advisory committee voted last week to recommend authorizing Moderna and Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 booster doses. Enditem
