Photo taken on Oct. 29, 2021 shows a jadeware excavated at Liangjiatan relics site, at Hanshan Museum in Hanshan County, east China's Anhui Province. Beijing unveiled the medals for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games on Oct. 26. Named "Tongxin", meaning "Together as one", the medals feature five concentric rings, and their backside design was inspired by the "Bi" jadeware discovered at the Lingjiatan relics site in Anhui Province. Dating back to about 5,300 years to 5,800 years ago, Lingjiatan is known for the discovery of more than 1,000 pieces of jadeware, offering a vivid demonstration of ancient Chinese culture. The archaeological excavation of the Lingjiatan relics site is still ongoing. (Xinhua/Zhou Mu)
