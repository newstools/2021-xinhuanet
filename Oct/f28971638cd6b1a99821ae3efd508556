HONG KONG, Oct. 29 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government said on Friday that it recorded a 115.7-billion-Hong Kong dollar (14.88-billion-U.S. dollar) deficit during the April-September period 2021. Announcing its financial results for the six months ended Sept. 30, 2021, the HKSAR government said expenditure amounted to 316 billion Hong Kong dollars (40.63 billion U.S. dollars) and revenue 200.3 billion Hong Kong dollars (25.75 billion U.S. dollars). A spokesperson for the HKSAR government said the cumulative year-to-date deficit for the period was mainly due to the fact that some major types of revenue including salaries and profits taxes are mostly received towards the end of a financial year. The fiscal reserves stood at 812.1 billion Hong Kong dollars as of Sept. 30. Enditem
