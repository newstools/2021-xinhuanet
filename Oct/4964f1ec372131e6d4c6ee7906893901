ISLAMABAD, Oct. 20 (Xinhua) -- Four people were killed in an explosion targeting law enforcement agencies in Bajaur tribal district of Pakistan's northwest Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Wednesday night, the district's police chief said. The killed included two policemen and two personnel from paramilitary troops Frontier Corps (FC), who were investigating another blast that happened in the afternoon in the area, District Police Officer Abdul Samad Khan told Xinhua. "In the afternoon blast, some elders from the area were injured when their vehicle was attacked near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. When the police and FC reached the site for investigation, the second and major blast happened, leaving the four killed right at the spot," he said. He said that both attacks were launched by improvised explosive devices fixed and hidden in the grass near the road. "A joint investigation and a search operation by police and FC are underway in the area, and we will be able to trace and nab the fleeing militants soon," he added. No group or individual has claimed responsibility for the attack yet. Once a hotbed of militancy, the tribal districts of the country including Bajaur started to see peace, following extensive operations by the Pakistani military to flush out militants and eliminate their sanctuaries from the area. Normalcy has been largely restored in the area and routine life activities have been resumed, but sporadic attacks on law enforcers happen whenever militants get a chance to sneak through the security shield of law enforcers.
