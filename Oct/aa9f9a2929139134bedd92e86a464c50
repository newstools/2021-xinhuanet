by Yosley Carrero HAVANA, Oct. 25 (Xinhua) -- China has been committed to advancing the cause of the United Nations (UN) and upholding multilateralism since the restoration of its lawful seat in the international body 50 years ago, a Cuban political expert has said. The restoration of the lawful seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations is an act of historical justice, Jose Luis Robaina, a senior researcher at Havana's Center for the Study of International Politics, said during a recent interview with Xinhua. Robaina, 74, studied Chinese history at Peking University in the 1960s, and worked as a correspondent in Beijing for Cuba's Prensa Latina news agency between 1980 and 1989 before serving as a diplomat in the Cuban embassy in China more than 10 years later. China stands against interference in the countries' internal affairs and has been playing a leading role in promoting multilateralism, Robaina stressed. On the Belt and Road Initiative, Robaina said, "China is not only respecting the rights of different countries involved, but introducing an unprecedented cooperation model." In a world facing multiple challenges including the COVID-19 pandemic, "China is more important than ever for the defense of plurality and for the search for a world of shared destiny, solidarity, peace and dialogue," he added.
