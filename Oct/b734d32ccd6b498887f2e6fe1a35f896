GUANGZHOU, Oct. 31 (Xinhua) -- A new species in the leaf-beetle genus has been found in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, with the study published in the international journal of Entomotaxonomia, a local research institute said. The new species, Sphenoraia Clark, which belongs to the tribe Hylaspini in the subfamily Galerucinae, was found by Chinese researchers in a downtown wetland park in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong Province. The snout-vent length of Sphenoraia Clark ranges from 6.0 mm to 6.5 mm. They are very appealing with unique features, such as a humped back and a yellow body with black spots, according to Yang Xingke with the institute of zoology of Guangdong Academy of Sciences. New species were usually spotted in the wild, so it was very rare to find the species in the central area of a major populous city, said Yang. The discovery also indicated the city's improving ecological environment, added Yang. Enditem
