TAIPEI, Oct. 29 (Xinhua) -- A painting exhibition being held in Taiwan aims to increase cultural exchanges between the island and the Chinese mainland. The exhibition, which features nearly 50 paintings drawn by 24 artists from across the Strait, depicts the great beauty of the landscape in the western region of the Chinese mainland. At the opening ceremony held via video link on Friday, artists said that this exhibition would help facilitate cross-Strait cultural exchanges and cooperation, and promote the prosperous development of culture and art both in Taiwan and the Chinese mainland. "The exchanges between artists from across the Strait had been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic," said Huang Kuang-Nan, former president of Taiwan University of Arts, at the exhibition, adding that "we hoped the face-to-face exchanges could resume next year and artists could jointly inherit and develop the Chinese culture and aesthetics." The exhibition will last until Sunday in New Taipei City. Enditem
