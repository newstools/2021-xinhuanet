A brief press statement released by Aden's security administration said that "terrorist elements detonated a car bomb this evening near the first checkpoint at the main entrance of Aden's airport." It confirmed that the car bomb attack resulted in the killing of five people and injuring more than 25 others, including children and women. The security services cordoned off the bombing site, while medical teams rushed to transfer the wounded to hospitals in Aden for treatment. The unidentified terror elements blew up a car loaded with explosives near the outer gate of the airport, leading to the destruction of a number of vehicles and residential homes in the same neighborhood, it added. There has been no claim of responsibility of the attack. But local security forces blamed militants of terror groups for being behind. Considered Yemen's temporary capital city, Aden is where the Saudi-backed Yemeni government has based itself since 2015. Local authorities are trying to maintain security and stability in the strategic Yemeni port city. However, sporadic bombing incidents and drive-by shooting attacks still occur in Aden. The impoverished Arab country has been locked into a civil war since late 2014, when Houthi rebels overran much of the country and seized all northern provinces, including the capital Sanaa. Enditem
