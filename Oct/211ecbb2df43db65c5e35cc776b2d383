 Afghanistan's Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock on Sunday launched a plan to create jobs and fight a potential food crisis amid the continuous rise of poverty and unemployment. "More steps will be taken soon by the government to promote common prosperity for all," Minister of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock Abdul Rahman Rashid told reporters. The plan was launched after it was approved by the council of ministers of Afghanistan's caretaker government, according to the minister. As part of the nationwide plan, a food-for-work program was launched in Kabul province, where the country's capital is located, the minister noted. "More than 40,000 people will be provided with jobs, they will receive wheat as they work, and the initiative will be expanded to other provinces," said the minister. UN agencies, aid organizations and a number of non-governmental organizations are also racing against the time to deliver life-saving aid and supplies to crisis-hit Afghans ahead of winter.
