DUBLIN, Oct. 20 (Xinhua) -- Ireland, with a population slightly over 5 million, has seen a total of 5,369 people die of the novel coronavirus, according to official figures released on Wednesday. The northern European country reported an additional 2,148 COVID-19 cases, the Irish Department of Health said in a statement. "Disease incidence is high and increasing across the country and across all age groups," said Tony Holohan, chief medical officer with the department of health. Holohan's comments came at a time when more COVID-19 restrictions in Ireland are scheduled to be lifted on Friday despite surging cases in the country over the last couple of weeks. Starting from Friday, Ireland will no longer place capacity limits on any outdoor events or limit the number of people attending weddings and religious services as the nightclubs in the country will also be reopened for the first time since the pandemic. On Tuesday, the country reported 2,399 new cases of COVID-19, the highest daily figure since January. Enditem
