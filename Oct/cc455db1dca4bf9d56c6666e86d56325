NEW YORK, Oct. 29 (Xinhua) -- The Thanksgiving dinner this year could be the most expensive meal in the history of the holiday, The New York Times reported Monday. The newspaper said that this year the cost of many foods has jumped sharply and turkey prices are likely to hit record highs. High transportation costs, knotted supply chain, labor shortages, trade policies and bad weather have pushed up the prices of many food materials. Meanwhile, inflation is at play. In September, the Consumer Price Index for food was up 4.6 percent from a year ago. Prices for meat, poultry, fish and eggs soared 10.5 percent, the paper said. Enditem
