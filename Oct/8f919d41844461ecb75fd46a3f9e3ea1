LUANDA, Oct. 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the Angolan authorities prepared to promote a project on sustainable fire management, the UN agency said in a press release on Wednesday. During a technical seminar which was held as part of the preparation of the Sustainable Fire Management Project, Gherda Barreto, the FAO representative in Angola, promised total availability to provide technical support to address the African country's environmental and climate challenges. "FAO is an agency accredited with the Green Climate Fund as grant-implementing entity for medium size projects, up to 250 million U.S. dollars," said Barreto, noting the fund is the largest instrument for financing climate change mitigation and adaptation projects. Manuel Lutango, deputy national commander for the management of civil protection and fire brigade, said that the country registered 150,777 fires from May 15 to August 15. "We must implement and intensify local and community actions, with the adoption of practices and techniques suitable for hunting, charcoal production and preparation of agricultural fields," said Lutango. The press release underscores that the results of this technical meeting will be part of a project to be presented to the Green Climate Fund's governing board in April 2022 for funding. Enditem
