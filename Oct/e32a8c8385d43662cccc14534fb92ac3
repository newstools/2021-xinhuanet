Delivering the Autumn Budget and Spending Review in the House of Commons (lower house of the British parliament), Sunak said the Budget aims for "a new economy post COVID", an economy of "higher wages, higher skills, and rising productivity". "At the start of this Parliament, resource spending on healthcare was 133 billion pounds (about 182.55 billion dollars)," said Sunak. "Today's Budget does not draw a line under COVID; we have challenging months ahead." Sunak announced that the country will permanently cut the Universal Credit taper rate by 8 percent. Additionally, the National Living Wage will grow by 6.6 percent to 9.50 pounds (13.04 dollars) an hour from April 1, 2022. Meanwhile, the chancellor unveiled "the most radical simplification of alcohol duties for over 140 years", slashing the number of main duty rates on alcohol from 15 percent to 6 percent. Sunak said the British economy is expected to grow by 6.5 percent in 2021 and 6 percent in 2022, based on forecast by the British Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR), an executive non-departmental public body giving independent and authoritative analysis of Britain's public finances. The chancellor noted the inflation in September 2021 was 3.1 percent and "is likely to rise further - with the OBR expecting the CPI (Consumer Price Index) to average 4 percent over next year." "The majority of this rise in inflation can be explained by two global forces," said Sunak, adding that "First, as economies around the world reopen, demand for goods has increased more quickly than supply chains can meet" and "second, global demand for energy has surged." Meanwhile, the OBR expected unemployment to peak at 5.2 percent this year. Underlying debt is forecast to be 85.2 percent of GDP this year, then 85.4 percent in 2022-23, before peaking at 85.7 percent in 2023-24. Britain has lifted most COVID restrictions thanks to the progress of its vaccine campaign. Another 43,951 people in Britain have tested positive for COVID-19 and the country also reported a further 207 coronavirus-related deaths, according to official figures released Wednesday. More than 86 percent of people aged 12 and over in Britain have had their first dose of vaccine and more than 79 percent have received both doses, the latest figures showed. To bring life back to normal, countries such as Britain, China, Germany, Russia and the United States have been racing against time to roll out coronavirus vaccines. Enditem
