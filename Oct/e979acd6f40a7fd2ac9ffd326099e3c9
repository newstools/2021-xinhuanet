JERUSALEM, Oct. 25 (Xinhua) -- Israel has approved a plan to increase energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the country's energy and environmental protection ministries said in a joint statement on Monday. The plan, with a budget of 725 million shekels (226 million U.S. dollars), was approved ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) which will be held from Oct. 31 in Glasgow, United Kingdom. Of the total amount, 450 million shekels will be allocated to grants for energy efficiency and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, including conversion from fuels to electricity and energy storage in industry, the statement said. Steps will be taken to increase energy efficiency, including replacing old and inefficient technologies with new and cost-effective ones such as lighting systems, air conditioning and heat pumps, it said. About 150 million shekels will be allocated to plans for preparing for climate change and promoting sustainable energy in cities and towns, it said. At the same time, 60 million shekels will be allocated for the building infrastructure for electric transportation throughout the country, the statement said. The rest of the fund will be allocated to the generation of solar energy on rooftops, community energy, independent energy buildings, training and education in the field, it added. Enditem
