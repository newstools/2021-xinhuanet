Huang Shuofu, an inheritor of Guilin bamboo circular fan making technique, writes on a fan in Dingjiang Township of Guilin, south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Oct. 29, 2021. Making of such a fan is not a simple task, craftsmen cut the soaked bamboo into dozens of strips to make fan frame, paste the surface with Xuan paper, cotton cloth and silk, finally make the circular fan through cutting and edge wrapping, and a good painting and/or calligraphic writing makes it a popular item in the cultural market.
