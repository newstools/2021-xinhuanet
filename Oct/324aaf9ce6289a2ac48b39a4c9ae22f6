 People watch sheep and goats walking through the city center on the occasion of the Transhumance Festival in Madrid, Spain, Oct. 24, 2021. Thousands of sheep and cows were paraded through the city center here during a celebration of the Transhumance Festival on Sunday, a centuries-old tradition in Spain. The festival originated from the transhumance practice, in which shepherds in winter drove their cattle and sheep from the mountains to the warm meadows and in summer returned to the mountains to ensure their animals are well fed.
