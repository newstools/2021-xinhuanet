ISLAMABAD, Oct. 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States, driven by political-corporate greed, robbed Afghanistan of its stability and tranquility, tearing apart tens of thousands of families over the past 20 years, said an article recently published by Pakistan's English-language daily the Pakistan Observer. "In the Afghan war where loss is reckoned in lives, the only winner is the U.S. military-industrial complex," said the article titled "What is an Afghan Life Worth?" The article highlighted how the politicians and policymakers use private defense contractors to feed the longest war in U.S. history and sustain U.S. dominance over other countries at concealed financial and human costs, away from public oversight. "Every year, around half of discretionary spending of the United States is taken by defense spending, over half of which goes to contractors. In 2019, for example, the pay check of the defense monopolies was 370 billion U.S. dollars in total," said the article. So, major defense companies in the United States and their stakeholders have made a fortune from bloodshed, the article said, adding that "the defense contractors ramp up donations for supportive individuals and committees wielding control over defense spending to gain more say in political debates." "The decisions to start and sustain wars are thus shaped by people with vested interests in extending the war as long as possible," the article added. Enditem
