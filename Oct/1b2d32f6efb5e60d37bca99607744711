by Martina Fuchs GENEVA, Oct. 21 (Xinhua) -- China is a critical pillar in the multipolar world and is expected to assume more responsibility to contribute to the global agenda to build an inclusive, sustainable and resilient economy and planet, a senior United Nations (UN) official has said. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the restoration of the People's Republic of China's lawful seat in the UN. On Oct. 25, 1971, the 26th Session of the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 2758 with an overwhelming majority and decided to restore the lawful seat of the People's Republic of China in the world body. "China is an example of remarkable economic development in recent history," Isabelle Durant, acting secretary-general of the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), said in a recent interview with Xinhua. She added that China has achieved extraordinary growth, lifting millions of people out of poverty. China's involvement in global trade has increased massively, with a share reaching 15 percent of the world's total, Durant pointed out. "China has become the global manufacturing powerhouse, exporting to nearly every corner of the world," she said. "The country has also gradually upgraded its production and is now exporting goods and services of diverse complexity." Durant said global production networks were affected following the outbreak of COVID-19 but China "showed strong resilience with its trade picking up fast and even expanding its share in global trade." She also praised China's role as an important partner for the UNCTAD and its work. Enditem
