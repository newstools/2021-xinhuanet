Exports to Belt and Road countries hit around 367.8 billion yuan, up nearly 40 percent, year on year. Imports from these countries grew 43.6 percent to about 292 billion yuan, showed statistics announced at a press conference held Monday by the provincial government. Meanwhile, the province's trade with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) accounted for more than 45 percent of its total trade volume with Belt and Road countries during the period.
