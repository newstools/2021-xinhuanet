The Jilin-1 Gaofen 02F satellite was launched by a Kuaizhou-1A (KZ-1A) carrier rocket at 2:19 p.m. (Beijing Time) and entered the planned orbit. It is an optical remote sensing satellite that can provide high resolution images and high-speed data transmission. Kuaizhou-1A, which is Chinese for fast ship, is a low-cost small solid-fuel carrier rocket that has a short preparation period. Developed by the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation, the rocket is designed to launch low-orbit satellites weighing under 300 kg. Since their first commercial mission in 2017, KZ-1A rockets have sent 21 satellites into space. Wednesday's launch was the 12th mission by Kuaizhou-1A series rockets, according to the launch center.
