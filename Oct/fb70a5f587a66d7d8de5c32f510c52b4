ISTANBUL, Oct. 24 (Xinhua) -- Three paragliding pilots were wounded on Sunday after they collided in mid-air and fell into the sea at an air games festival in Turkey's southwestern province of Mugla, local media reported. Cagdas Turkmen, a 42-year-old solo paragliding pilot, hit Ibrahim Kars, 40, and Murat Can Sak, 25, according to the Demiroren news agency. The mishap occurred during a flight at the 21st Oludeniz International Air Games Festival, it said. The pilots reportedly fell into the sea from a height of about 20 meters after they got their parachutes tangled. Demiroren noted that Turkmen, who was flying solo from the 1500-meter runway of Babadag Mountain, was in critical condition. The five-day-long festival kicked off on Oct. 20 in the popular resort town of Fethiye. Enditem
