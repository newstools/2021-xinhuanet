 Award-winning Australian photographer Scott Portelli is one of those fortunate people who have turned an unwavering passion into a creative career. "I've always been fascinated by most animals, wildlife, marine life, nature, our environment, our landscapes," he told Xinhua. The all-consuming fascination led Portelli to leave his marketing job to take his cameras for some of the world's most scenic regions including the Arctic, Antarctica, Africa, and South Pacific islands. His close and personal portraits have garnered international awards, the most recent being Australian Geographic Nature Photographer of the Year for an ethereal image of a leafy sea dragon staring deep into the camera lens. Portelli hopes the photographs can raise his audience's awareness of the importance of wildlife conservation. Environmental awareness includes an understanding of the role of biodiversity in healthy ecosystems.  Produced by Xinhua Global Service
