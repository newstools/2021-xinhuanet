WASHINGTON, Oct. 29 (Xinhua) -- Since the U.S. administration planned too little budget on public health, the United States could make the same pandemic preparedness mistakes again, said an article published on the Vox website Thursday. Public health officials and outside experts warned the U.S. government for years before the coronavirus pandemic that the United States was not focusing enough on public health prevention, and they were proven right, said the article, adding that the country is in danger of repeating the same mistakes made during the earlier period of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Build Back Better legislation totals some 10 billion U.S. dollars in public health infrastructure and pandemic preparedness funding over the next few years, which is far short of what experts think is necessary, it said. "Outside experts have estimated that as much as 75 billion U.S. dollars should be spent over 10 years on public health infrastructure, preparedness, and prevention," said the article. Enditem
