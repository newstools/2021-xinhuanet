COLOMBO, Oct. 26 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has signed several memorandums of understanding (MoUs) ensuring a steady flow of foreign currency which will help the country achieve close to 5 percent growth in 2021, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) said Tuesday. The bank said in a statement that the government and it are conducting direct engagements with foreign governments, central banks, financial institutions, and investors in order to ensure foreign currency inflows. Ongoing deals include a 200 million U.S. dollar property development project in Colombo, a 650 million U.S. dollar investment into the Port of Colombo's West Terminal, and a partial divestment of a state-owned LNG plant to US company New Fortress Energy for 25 million U.S. dollars. The CBSL said that initial cash transfers for these deals are expected before the end of the year and will help buffer the country's foreign exchange reserves. Negotiations are also underway to finalize currency swaps with a number of central banks of other countries. The CBSL added that yields on government securities have adjusted upwards, while the Colombo Stock Exchange's All Share Price Index has reached record highs and lending to the private sector has increased. "These developments also indicate that economic growth close to 5 percent in 2021 is very likely," the CBSL said. Enditem
