 Dozens of youths from China and Africa have gathered in Beijing for the sixth China-Africa Youth Festival this week. The event is hosted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and organized by the China Soong Ching Ling Foundation. Fatma, an Egyptian student from the North China University of Technology, said that virus origins tracing has been politicized. Joseph Oliver Mendoo, a Cameroonian Ph.D. student in international politics at Peking University, has been in China for almost six years. He said that politicizing origins tracing is not the right thing to do, because people's safety should be the priority for the world.  Produced by Xinhua Global Service
