UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 22 (Xinhua) -- The international community should further promote coordination and cooperation on protecting women's security and boosting their development, a Chinese envoy said Thursday. "The international community should step up efforts to coordinate actions and give more prominence to the agenda of women, peace and security," Dai Bing, China's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations (UN), said during a UN Security Council open debate on women, peace and security. It remains "a formidable task" to protect women in armed conflicts, promote their political participation, and comprehensively advance their rights and interests, Dai noted, citing the situation of women in Afghanistan as an example. "In Afghanistan, women have paid dearly for the 20-year-long war. Recent hasty withdrawals of foreign forces have presented them with huge risks and challenges," he said. The Chinese envoy called on countries around the world to strengthen protection for women in armed conflicts, offer continued support for women's participation in peacekeeping and peacebuilding, and more vigorously advance women's economic empowerment. Noting that China has been actively supporting women's participation in peacekeeping, and carrying out global cooperation on women's issues to advance their development, Dai said China, along with the international community, "stands ready to work to accelerate the realization of gender equality, and promote global women's development so as to jointly build a community of a shared and better future for women, for everyone."
