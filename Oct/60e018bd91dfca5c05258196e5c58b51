BERLIN, Oct. 26 (Xinhua) -- Sentiment in the German export industry took a "significant hit" in October as the monthly indicator for export expectations fell from 20.5 to 13.0 points, the Munich-based ifo Institute said on Tuesday. "Supply problems in intermediate products are now having an impact on manufacturing exports," said the institute's President, Clemens Fuest, in a statement. Expectations in Germany's electronic industry declined but still remained high, with companies "continuing to expect good international business," the institute noted. Last week, the Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers' Association (ZVEI) said that the industry's exports to China increased by 11.1 percent year-on-year to 2.1 billion euros (2.44 billion U.S. dollars) in August as China remained the largest customer for German electrical exports. The chemical industry in Germany, on the other hand, has suffered a more significant setback and "growth rates will be significantly slower," the ifo Institute noted. The situation is similarly bleak in the country's important automotive industry. Germany's automotive manufacturers and suppliers have been hit hard by the global chip shortage that has already wreaked on the production schedules of several plants. The Center Automotive Research (CAR) expects this year to be even more difficult than last year for German carmakers in their domestic market. In 2020, more than 2.9 million new cars were registered in Germany, and this would not be matched in 2021. The ifo Institute's surveys were based on around 2,300 monthly reports from German manufacturers about their export expectations for the next three months. (1 euro = 1.16 U.S. dollar) Enditem
