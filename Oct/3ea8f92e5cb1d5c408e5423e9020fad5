KHARTOUM, Oct. 26 (Xinhua) -- General Commander of Sudanese Armed Forces Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan on Tuesday said the declared state of emergency would be lifted as soon as the rule institutions are formed. "The state of emergency is not meant to restrict freedom, whether press freedom or others," said Al-Burhan at a press conference in Khartoum. "The state of emergency will be cancelled as soon as the institutions are formed," he said, noting that the internet and communication services would resume gradually. On Monday, Al-Burhan declared a state of emergency across the country, dissolved the transitional Sovereign Council and the government, and relieved the state governors. Since then, demonstrators have taken to the street in Khartoum, rejecting the measures announced by Al-Burhan and demanding a civilian government. Enditem
