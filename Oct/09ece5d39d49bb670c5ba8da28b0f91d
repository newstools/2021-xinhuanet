HANGZHOU, Oct. 29 (Xinhua) -- An international conference featuring China's renowned Longquan celadon ceramics started on Friday in Longquan, a city in east China's Zhejiang Province. Titled "Legendary Longquan of the World, Marvelous Ingenuity of Ceramics Works," the 4th World Celadon Conference will show the history and role in the cultural exchange of the green-glazed Chinese ceramic art through 28 activities. Exhibitions, performances, forums and seminars will be held during the three-day conference, attracting artists, diplomatic envoys and owners of relevant enterprises from around the world. Relevant exhibitions have also been taking place in Romania, Singapore, and Belgium from September to December. The conference also includes activities to promote the online sales of celadon products, as part of efforts to develop relevant industries. Longquan celadon refers to ceramics produced at large kilns in Jincun in Longquan and other sites in Zhejiang Province, as well as ceramics produced elsewhere using the same techniques. The making of Longquan celadon dates back to the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127). In 2009, the firing technology of Longquan celadon was inscribed on the "Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity" by UNESCO. Enditem
