 Renqiu, Oct. 23 (Xinhua) -- As one of the main building materials of ancient buildings, cyan brick has a history of more than 2000 years in China. The process of making cyan brick is complex. So it is difficult to realize mechanized production. It takes five or six years just to dry and weather the soil. But only two or three thousand bricks can be produced in one furnace in the traditional way. There is an ancient brick kiln in Chu'an Town of Renqiu City, Hebei Province, north China. The kiln was built during the reign of Emperor Daoguang in the Qing Dynasty(1644-1911). It resumed production in the 1980s. A brick factory in Chu'an Town built on the basis of this kiln has followed the traditional manual brick making process, and the finished products are navy blue with antique appearance. Products produced by this factory, such as cyan bricks, glazes and antique architectural decorations, have been used in the renovation of ancient buildings such as the Forbidden City, the Temple of Heaven, the Summer Palace and the Eastern Qing Tombs for more than 30 years.
