SHANGHAI, Oct. 23 (Xinhua) -- A retrospective of famous Italian film directors opened in Shanghai on Saturday. Launched by the Shanghai Art Film Federation, the exhibition that lasts until Nov. 7 will screen nine films by four Italian filmmakers -- Pier Paolo Pasolini, Dario Argento, Bernardo Bertolucci and Vittorio De Sica. The films selected for screening include Mamma Roma, Edipo re, Suspiria, Umberto D., and Prima della rivoluzione. "About 14,000 tickets have been sold," said Michele Cecchi, Italy's Consul General in Shanghai, who was impressed by Chinese audiences' passion for Italian films. "People of the two countries experience each other's culture through films," said Cecchi, adding that Chinese films are increasingly being embraced by Italian audiences, too. "Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, international travel has been restricted," he said. "I hope this retrospective could serve as a platform for cultural exchanges between Italy and China." Enditem
