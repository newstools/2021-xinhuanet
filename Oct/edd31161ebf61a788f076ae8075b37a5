TAIYUAN, Oct. 24 (Xinhua) -- Major coal producers in north China's Shanxi Province, a leading coal-producing region of the country, have beefed up production to ensure energy supply. According to data from the provincial bureau of statistics, in the first three quarters of this year, the raw coal output of the major coal-producing enterprises in the province amounted to 880 million tonnes, a year-on-year increase of 11.6 percent.
