WASHINGTON, Oct. 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has partnered with the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), non-profit organizations and pharmaceutical companies to accelerate development of gene therapies for the 30 million Americans who suffer from rare diseases. While there are approximately 7,000 rare diseases, only two heritable diseases currently have FDA-approved gene therapies, according to the agency. The newly launched program, called Bespoke Gene Therapy Consortium, aims to optimize and streamline the gene therapy development process to help fill the unmet medical needs of people with rare diseases, said the FDA on Wednesday. "Most rare diseases are caused by a defect in a single gene that could potentially be targeted with a customized or 'bespoke' therapy that corrects or replaces the defective gene," said NIH Director Francis Collins. "There are now significant opportunities to improve the complex development process for gene therapies that would accelerate scientific progress and, most importantly, provide benefit to patients by increasing the number of effective gene therapies," he said. Gene therapy development for rare diseases is highly complex, time consuming and expensive. Moreover, the development process is stymied by limited access to tools and technologies, lack of standards across the field, and a one-disease-at-a-time approach to therapeutic development. A standardized therapeutic development model that includes a common gene delivery technology could allow for a more efficient approach to specific gene therapies, saving time and cost, according to the FDA.
