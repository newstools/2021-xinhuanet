(Xinhua/Chen Zhonghao) BEIJING, Oct. 27 (Xinhua) -- China's 2021 box office revenue totaled 42 billion yuan (about 6.58 billion U.S. dollars) as of Wednesday. Its growth was slower than in 2019 before the pandemic, but the total revenue still led the global box office markets. Eight of this year's top 10 earners at China's box office are domestic productions. Topping the yearly chart is the Chinese New Year comedy "Hi, Mom" with 5.41 billion yuan, which is currently the second highest-grossing film of all time in China, showed data by e-ticketing platform Maoyan. Patriotic blockbuster "The Battle at Lake Changjin" now ranks second, garnering a cumulative total of about 5.36 billion yuan since its release on Sept. 30. Maoyan predicts the war epic will complete its run with 5.5 billion yuan. The comedy "Detective Chinatown 3," also opening during the Spring Festival moviegoing period like "Hi, Mom," comes in third with 4.52 billion yuan. The only two foreign films in the top 10 are the U.S. productions "F9: The Fast Saga" and "Godzilla vs. Kong," respectively ranking fifth and eighth, with 1.39 billion yuan and 1.23 billion yuan.  ■
