NEW YORK, Oct. 29 (Xinhua) -- Former General Electric (GE) CEO Jeff Immelt has recently said that he is still very bullish on China and advised companies and business leaders not to pull back from its market. "In fact, if anything, if I were back in the seat running a public company, or a multinational company, I'd be investing more in China, not less," Yahoo Finance quoted him as saying at the all-virtual 2021 Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit this week. "It's (China's) going to be the biggest or second-biggest market in almost everything that's important," Immelt said. Solving problems like climate change requires trade and cooperation between China and the United States, he said, indicating that it is not possible for the two biggest economies not to have any kind of economic relationship.
