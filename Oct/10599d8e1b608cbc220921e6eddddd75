WASHINGTON, Oct. 27 (Xinhua) -- In the United States, the post-pandemic economic recovery showed a polarization trend, in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, according to an article published by the Open Access Government on Monday. "Since the start of the pandemic, inequality appears to have increased further," said the article, citing the Trade and Development Report from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. The U.S. economic recovery "is threatened by domestic problems that predate the pandemic, which are reflected in the rise of a divergent K-shaped recovery for lower and higher income groups," it said. "By 2019, decades of wage repression, weak social protection and industrial offshoring had left 80 million workers in precarious conditions, often in debt and with insufficient access to health care," read the article. "While average wages have roughly doubled since 1978, CEO compensation has risen by an astounding 1,322 percent." Enditem
