SYDNEY, Oct. 31 (Xinhua) -- A state funeral will be held to honor Australian entertainer and TV personality Bert Newton, who passed away at the age of 83 in his Melbourne home on Sunday. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews issued a statement to share his condolences and announce the funeral. "Bert Newton was an icon, a larrikin and a born entertainer," said Andrews. "We have never known TV without Bert - he was there from the beginning." State funerals in Australia are primarily reserved for long-serving senior public officials, however on rare occasions they are offered to people outside of politics who have made a significant contribution to the nation. Newton pioneered Australia's broadcasting industry since he first began his career as a television announcer in 1956. Over the course of his career, which spanned over 60 years, he became one of Australia's most well-known and beloved personalities. "But above all his achievements, he was a family man and his greatest partnership was with his wife of almost 50 years, Patti," said Andrews. Newton is survived by his wife and two children. Enditem
