TEHRAN, Oct. 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi and his Turkish counterpart, Suleyman Soylu, met in Tehran on Wednesday and signed a memorandum of understanding on security matters, Iran's PressTV reported on Thursday. "We had very good discussions, the relations between the two countries are very strong and deep," Vahidi told the press after the meeting. Issues discussed between the two ministers included the fight against terrorism, international crime, and arms smuggling, as well as cross-border exchanges and activities, and the possibilities of further joint cooperation in all fields including migration control, he added. For his part, Soylu described ties between Turkey and Iran as "not only diplomatic, but friendly and brotherly." Both Iran and Turkey, he added, are determined to fight illegal migrations, namely after the situation created in Afghanistan by the hasty withdrawal of U.S. and NATO forces. Further discussions between Turkey and Iran regarding the fight against terrorism, smuggling, and drugs must be held, the Turkish minister went on to say. Enditem
