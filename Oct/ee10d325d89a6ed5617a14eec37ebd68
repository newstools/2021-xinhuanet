Rural teacher Qin Xingguo rings a bell signaling beginning of class at a school in Haiyang Township, Lingchuan County, south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Oct. 28, 2021. Rural teacher Qin Xingguo works at the Antai teaching center in Haiyang Township. For the past 27 years, Qin has dedicated himself to helping the children here realize their dreams through education. As a toddler, Qin Xingguo's right foot was paralyzed due to polio. Since 1994, he has been teaching at three different places as far away as 15 kilometers from home. "Because of my leg disability, it takes me more than four hours to walk home, and I only go home on weekends," said Qin. "But it is worth the physical challenge." Qin has taught a large number of students over his career. "It is the greatest desire of a rural teacher like me to see my students graduate with a solid education and reach the outside world," he added. (Xinhua/Lu Boan)
