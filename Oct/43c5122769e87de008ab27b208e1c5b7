 Farmers in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are embracing cotton harvest. Resistant to drought and sandstorms, cotton is an indispensable crop for the farmers' livelihood in Xinjiang. The region has contributed nearly 90 percent of China's cotton production capacity and about 20 percent of the global cotton production. Cotton harvesting has become highly mechanized since about 10 years ago. More and more farmers have been free from arduous physical labor. The cotton harvest season in Xinjiang, China's largest cotton-producing region, will last until mid-November this year, with the output expected to reach 5.2 million tonnes. This year, more than 70 percent of the 2.48 million hectares of cotton fields in Xinjiang are harvested mechanically.  Produced by Xinhua Global Service
