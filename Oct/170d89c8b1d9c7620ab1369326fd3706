MONTEVIDEO, Oct. 23 (Xinhua) -- Uncapped defender Sebastian Caceres has been named in Uruguay's provisional squad for FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Argentina and Bolivia next month. The 22-year-old, who represented Uruguay at youth level, has impressed Celeste manager Oscar Tabarez with his performances for Club America in Mexico's Liga MX. As expected, Uruguay's 30-man squad includes Manchester United striker Edinson Cavani, Atletico Madrid forward Luis Suarez, Juventus midfielder Rodrigo Bentancur and Real Madrid midfielder Federico Valverde. Flamengo playmaker Giorgian de Arrascaeta was also called up after recovering from a thigh injury. Uruguay will host Argentina in Montevideo on November 12 before facing Bolivia in La Paz four days later. The Celeste have two losses and a draw from their past three qualifiers and are clinging to fifth spot in South America's 10-team group. The top four sides will automatically earn a berth in next year's World Cup in Qatar while the fifth-ranked team will advance to an intercontinental playoff. Following is the provisional Uruguay squad: Goalkeepers: Fernando Muslera, Martin Campana and Martin Silva. Defenders: Diego Godin, Jose Maria Gimenez, Sebastian Coates, Ronald Araujo, Sebastian Caceres, Maximiliano Falcon, Yonatthan Rak, Martin Caceres, Damian Suarez, Matias Vina and Joaquin Piquerez. Midfielders: Mauro Arambarri, Lucas Torreira, Rodrigo Bentancur, Matias Vecino, Federico Valverde, Manuel Ugarte, Fernando Gorriaran, Nahitan Nandez, Brian Rodriguez, Nicolas de la Cruz, Gaston Pereiro, David Terans and Giorgian de Arrascaeta. Forwards: Jonathan Rodriguez, Darwin Nunez, Maximiliano Gomez, Luis Suarez and Edinson Cavani. Enditem
