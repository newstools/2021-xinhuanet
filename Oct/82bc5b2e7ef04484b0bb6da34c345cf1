(Xinhua/Javed Dar) SRINAGAR, Indian-controlled Kashmir, Oct. 26 (Xinhua) -- At least six civilians including a woman were wounded Tuesday in a grenade attack in restive Indian-controlled Kashmir, police said. The grenade was hurled towards a convoy of the Indian army at Sumbal in Bandipora district, about 24 km north of Srinagar city, the summer capital of Indian-controlled Kashmir. Police said the grenade missed the intended target and exploded with a bang on the road, leaving civilians wounded. "Militants today lobbed a grenade towards an army convoy near a bus stand in Sumbal, which exploded and wounded six pedestrians including a woman," a police official in Bandipora said, "All of them have suffered splinter wounds and were immediately removed to hospital." The attack triggered panic in the market and people were seen running away from the spot for safety, eyewitnesses said. Soon after the attack, police contingents rushed to the spot and launched a manhunt to nab the attackers. There has been a surge in gunfights in the region during the past two weeks. A guerilla war is going on between militants, and Indian troopers have been stationed in the region since 1989. The militants often target government force personnel with grenade attacks or resort to firings. Kashmir, the Himalayan region divided between India and Pakistan, is claimed by both in full. Since their Independence from Britain, the two countries have fought three wars, two exclusively over Kashmir. Enditem
