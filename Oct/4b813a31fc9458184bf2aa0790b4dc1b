A cotton picker works in the fields of Erken Reyimu in Yuli County, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Oct. 24, 2021. As vast swathes of blooming cotton in Xinjiang awaits the harvest this month, technology adopted in planting, spraying and other processes have gradually manifested its effect. Cotton farmer Erken Reyimu said seeding, insecticide spraying and cotton-picking on his 33-hectare cotton field are all done by machines. "With cotton yield reaching 400 kg per mu, I hopefully can bring home over 1 million yuan (about 155,500 U.S. dollars) this year," he said with a smile. Using the income out of his cotton farm, he has bought an apartment for his elder son and a car for his elder daughter. He plans to buy a car for his younger son at the end of this year. Xinjiang is the largest cotton-growing area in China. The region's cotton output hit 5.16 million tonnes in 2020, accounting for 87.3 percent of the total in the country. (Xinhua/Zhao Ge)
