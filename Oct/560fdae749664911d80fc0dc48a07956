The seven-truck convoy has been loaded with 100 tonnes of products including dried fruit, carpets, saffron and handicrafts, according to Mohammad Abdullah Bilall, director of Kabul Customs Office. The shipment will pass through Central Asian countries via Hairatan port city, along Afghanistan-Uzbekistan border, the official noted.
