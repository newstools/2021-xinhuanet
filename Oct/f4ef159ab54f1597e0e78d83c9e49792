BEIJING, Oct. 22 (Xinhua) -- China has made progress in sorting and utilization of household garbage in urban areas, according to a report on the enforcement of the Law on Prevention and Control of Environmental Pollution by Solid Waste. All provincial-level regions in China have made their plans to advance waste sorting, stated the report, which was submitted to the ongoing session of the National People's Congress Standing Committee for review. Waste sorting covered nearly 95 percent of residential communities in 46 pilot cities across China by the end of 2020, the report noted. In 2020, Chinese cities collected and transported 235 million tonnes of household refuse, and 99.7 percent of the garbage underwent harmless disposal, according to the report.
