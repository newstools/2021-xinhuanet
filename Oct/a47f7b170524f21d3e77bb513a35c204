KHARTOUM, Oct. 26 (Xinhua) -- General Commander of the Sudanese Armed Forces Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan on Tuesday vowed to achieve democratic transition in Sudan and preserve the December Revolution. "We want to correct the path of the transition and what we did is not a military coup," said Al-Burhan at a press conference in Khartoum. "The coming government will be a pure civilian government comprising of national competencies and will not include any partisans," he added.
