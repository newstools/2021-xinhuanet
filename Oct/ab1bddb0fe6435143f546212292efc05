BEIJING, Oct. 22 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese mainland spokesperson on Friday voiced strong opposition to any attempt of seeking "Taiwan independence" through so-called constitutional amendments. Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, made the comments in response to Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority's submission of draft "constitutional amendments" to the island's legislative body for deliberation. Anyone who takes the lead in the "constitutional amendments," which would make convenient the path to seeking "Taiwan independence," will be held accountable, Ma said. Ma called on responsible political parties and individuals on the island to identify political plots and wrongful intentions, and make joint efforts to safeguard peace and stability across the Strait. "Taiwan compatriots should also oppose and resist all attempts of seeking 'Taiwan independence' through so-called constitutional amendments," Ma said. Enditem
