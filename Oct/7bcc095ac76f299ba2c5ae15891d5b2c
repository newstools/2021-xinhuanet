NEW YORK, Oct. 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S.-headquartered multinational conglomerate Honeywell International Inc. eyes business prospects from both traditional and renewable energy in China with the release of its earnings report for the third quarter, the company head said on Friday. "Our growth in China continues to be robust. We were up high single digits in Q3 and we actually don't see that abating," Darius Adamczyk, chairman and chief executive officer of Honeywell International, said at the earnings call for the third quarter of 2021. Adamczyk said Honeywell's position in China continues to be very good, adding that the twofold opportunity comes from Chinese reinvestment cycles in traditional energy as well as an accelerated and more pronounced investment cycle in renewables. China's current efforts to generate more energy to support the industry in the fourth quarter will create a very favorable investment environment and business opportunities for Honeywell, Adamczyk said. Adamczyk said he is also very excited about China's focus on sustainability, believing that Honeywell could be a major player in China. Honeywell recorded 8.473 billion U.S. dollars of net sales revenues in the third quarter, up 9 percent year on year, with net income in the quarter jumping 65.83 percent year on year to reach 1.257 billion dollars, according to its earnings report issued Friday.
