In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, the CEO of Kerchanshe Trading PLC, Israel Degfa, said his company would be participating in the expo through its agent in China. Israel said the expo plays an important role in further promoting the ever-growing Chinese import of Ethiopian coffee. Israel, who is from a coffee farming family, insists that coffee quality and flavors are the results of dedicated scientific endeavors and processes. Kerchanshe is producing and exporting different varieties of coffee by operating with 63 washing stations, 56,000 out-growers, and also 1,500 hectares of land dedicated to research and development of improved varieties of coffee. According to the Ethiopian Coffee and Tea Authority, China was among the top 10 buyers of Ethiopian coffee in the months of July and August 2021. Stating that China's imports of Ethiopia's coffee are increasing dramatically, the CEO said the country would be among the top five buyers of Ethiopian coffee in the next two to three years. The 4th CIIE is scheduled to be held in Shanghai from Nov. 5 to 10.
