BEIRUT, Oct. 21 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Michel Aoun said on Thursday that the international auditing firm Alvarez & Marsal has begun its forensic audit of the Lebanese central bank, the National News Agency reported. The president's remarks came during his meeting with UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon Joanna Wronecka. The forensic audit came to a halt about a year ago when restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal withdrew, saying it had not received the required data from the central bank. The forensic audit is one of the conditions imposed by the International Monetary Fund to unlock aid for the crisis-hit country. Lebanon has been going through an economic crisis branded by the World Bank as one of the world's worst. Enditem
