JOHANNESBURG, Oct. 19 (Xinhua) -- Major social media platforms have joined the Electoral Commission of South Africa and Media Monitoring Africa (MMA) to combat fake news as the country is prepared to hold local government elections. In a joint statement released on Tuesday, TikTok, Google, Facebook, Twitter, the commission and MMA said they will fight against disinformation in the run-up to the elections scheduled for Nov. 1 and afterwards. They have also created a special hub where South African users can find all the information they need ahead of the elections. Fake news undermined people's rights including freedom of expression, access to credible information and the freedom to make informed political choices, the electoral commission's Vice Chairperson Janet Love said in the statement. The commission will use an MMA-developed system, namely the Real411, to address disinformation and misinformation, and a software called PADRE to identify and eliminate misinformation in advertisements published in all media, she added. "The dissemination of disinformation has huge potential to undermine the fairness and credibility of elections. It also threatens democratic political and policy-making processes," Love said. Enditem
