SUVA, Oct. 22 (Xinhua) -- Fijian Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama said on Friday that the country will reopen clubs, bars, taverns and gaming venues from Nov. 11 as over 80 percent of the adult population have been fully vaccinated, according to a government statement. The venues will reopen for business in accordance with the Ministry of Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport's protocols, said the statement. Given that these businesses involve high customer interaction and close contact, they are only available for persons who are fully vaccinated. Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport Faiyaz Koya stressed the importance of creating a safe environment for businesses to re-open amid the pandemic. "At the end of the day, what we want and what we should strive towards is sustainability and resilience. How we invest in our workplaces and in our people today will reflect on our development in years to come," the minister said. The ministry, together with the Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission, has deployed "COVID-safe ambassadors" who will closely observe and advise businesses on mandatory minimum parameters for safe operation.
