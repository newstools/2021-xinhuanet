WASHINGTON, Oct. 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. state of Arizona experienced a 138 percent increase in average of daily new COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 people last week, data collected by The Washington Post has showed. Arizona on Saturday reported 3,145 new COVID-19 cases, twice as many daily cases as the state was reporting three months ago, the Post reported on Tuesday. The increase is mainly due to the highly contagious Delta variant, the lack of public health restrictions, and pockets of vaccine resistance among the elderly, Will Humble, executive director of Arizona's Public Health Association, was quoted by the article as saying. However, Arizona is not the only U.S. state with a concerning public health outlook, said the article, noting that daily deaths over the past seven days have increased by 267 percent in Alaska, by 143 percent in Montana, and by 100 percent in Rhode Island.
