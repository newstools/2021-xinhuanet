TEHRAN, Oct. 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has ended an advisory notice which warned against flying of commercial planes over Iran's airspace for "safety reasons," Siavosh Amir Mokri, head of the Civil Aviation Organization (CAO) of Iran, said on Saturday. To remove the nearly two-year restriction, the CAO and Iran Airports Company had engaged in negotiations with European airlines, the region's aviation authorities as well as the EASA, Amir Mokri was quoted as saying by Iran's state TV. The EASA issued the notice in January 2020, due to Tehran and Washington's regional confrontations and following Iran's fire of missiles against a U.S. base in Iraq in the same month. Enditem
