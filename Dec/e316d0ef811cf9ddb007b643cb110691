WELLINGTON, Dec. 16 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand has reached the 90 percent fully vaccinated milestone across the country, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said on Thursday. It means 3,788,151 New Zealanders have rolled up their sleeves to protect themselves, their families, friends and communities, he said. Hipkins added this means all New Zealanders are safer and more protected, and can get back to doing the things they love, such as travelling to catch up with friends and family for Christmas, heading out to restaurants, pubs and cafes, or enjoying the many festivals and outdoor events planned for the summer.
