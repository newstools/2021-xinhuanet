WASHINGTON, Dec. 18 (Xinhua) -- Limitations on the U.S.-China scientific and technological exchanges and collaboration, including restrictions on Chinese scientists and students, are in the interest of neither side, Chinese Ambassador to the United States Qin Gang has said. Qin made the remarks in an interview with Kim Montgomery, director of International Affairs and Science Diplomacy and executive editor of Science & Diplomacy magazine, on China's science diplomacy initiatives. The story was published on Friday. "Scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation have played an important role in the development of China-U.S. relations and are still an important part of our bilateral relationship," said Qin. Over the past four decades, more than 30 protocols and agreements in a wide range of areas including health, climate change, ecological protection and nuclear safety have been signed under the framework of agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between China and the United States, he said. "When China and the United States work together to address global issues as the ones I just mentioned, and jointly manage the uncertainties of emerging technologies, we can deliver greater benefits to our two peoples and better prepare humanity for an uncertain future," said Qin. The ambassador noted that even before the United States and China officially established diplomatic relations, then U.S. President Jimmy Carter's science advisor visited China. Since the establishment of diplomatic ties more than 40 years ago, China-U.S. relations have made historic progress, despite some twists and turns and the many differences in the two countries' social systems, histories, cultures and approaches to development, said Qin. "We are ready to work with the United States to respect each other, peacefully coexist, and pursue cooperation," he added. Enditem
