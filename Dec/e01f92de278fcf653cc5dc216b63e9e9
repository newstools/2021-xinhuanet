BOGOTA, Dec. 6 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's Dimayor professional football league said Monday it opened an investigation into Union Magdalena's controversial promotion to the country's top division. Union Magdalena were trailing in their second-tier match at Llaneros on Saturday before netting two stoppage time goals to win 2-1. The second goal, scored by center-back Jonathan Segura in the 96th minute, came after the home side appeared to stop defending. "Despite the obvious facts that all Colombians and the whole world have seen, we are going to respect due process and act within the regulations and statutes not only of Colombian football but of FIFA," Dimayor president Fernando Jaramillo told reporters. The result handed Union Magdalena a promotion berth at the expense of Fortaleza, who suffered a 2-1 home loss to Bogota. Jaramillo announced that he would also request that the attorney general's office investigate the circumstances that led to Union Magdalena's victory. While Dimayor could impose sporting penalties such as points deductions or bans, the attorney general could proceed with a criminal investigation, he said. Footage of Segura's goal went viral on social media and drew criticism from several high-profile public figures in Colombia, including President Ivan Duque, who described the episode as a "national disgrace". Juventus and Colombia international winger Juan Cuadrado said on social media that the result demonstrated a "lack of respect." Enditem
