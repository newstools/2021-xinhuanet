RIYADH, Dec. 7 (Xinhua) -- The Saudi-led coalition announced on Tuesday that a Houthi projectile fell near a public road and a traditional market in the Saudi Arabian border city of Jazan. The coalition accused the Houthi militia of "systematically targeting civilians," the Saudi Press Agency tweeted. Various areas in the kingdom, mainly border cities, are frequently targeted by the Houthis through missiles and drones, it said. Most of the attacks had been foiled before reaching their targets. The coalition completed its sixth year of war in Yemen against the Houthis in March 2021 to support Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. Enditem
