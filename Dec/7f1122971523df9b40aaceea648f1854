OTTAWA, Dec. 5 (Xinhua) -- Canada's populous provinces saw increasing daily COVID-19 cases recently, as more people gather indoors in the winter. Ontario, the most populous province with a population of 14 million, reported 1,184 new COVID-19 cases Sunday morning. It is the highest number in a single day since May 28. The province's rolling seven-day average of COVID-19 cases now stands at 926, up from 760 at this point last week. The cumulative caseload of the province has risen to 623,497, including 10,024 deaths. Of the reported cases on Sunday, 557 are people who were fully vaccinated, 536 are unvaccinated, and 22 have received one vaccine dose. "Individuals who are not fully vaccinated represent 23.4 percent of Ontario's total population," Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott said on Twitter Sunday. Meanwhile, Quebec, the second most populous province, with a population of 8.4 million, reported 1,256 new COVID-19 cases Sunday morning, raising the cumulative caseload to 454,636, including 11,587 deaths. According to the Quebec government, 81 percent of eligible Quebecers aged five and up are now fully vaccinated, with 86 percent having received at least one dose. Last week, Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) strongly recommended that all Canadians over the age of 50 and other vulnerable individuals including health care workers and those living in congregate care settings get a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine. In a new report issued on Friday, NACI also urged Canadians aged 18-49 to get a third shot at least six months after they got their second. Enditem
