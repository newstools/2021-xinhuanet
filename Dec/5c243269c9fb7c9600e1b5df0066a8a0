ACCRA, Dec. 21 (Xinhua) -- Ghana placed a travel ban on Israel, Malta, and the Republic of Korea in a bid to prevent a spread of the Omicron variant from those countries, said the foreign ministry late Monday. In two different releases, the foreign ministry said the bans on the Republic of Korea and Israel were temporary, lasting for 14 days from Dec. 20, while giving no indication of the duration of the ban on Malta. It added that Ghana did not recognize any vaccine certificate from Malta. On Dec.10, the West African country adopted tough restrictions by imposing a 3,500 U.S. dollar penalty per passenger on airlines that brought unvaccinated passengers to Ghana. Enditem
