HONG KONG, Dec. 14 (Xinhua) -- All preparations for the upcoming seventh-term Legislative Council (LegCo) election in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) have been put in place, HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam said Tuesday, calling on the Hong Kong residents to cast a vote of confidence for Hong Kong. Recently, the HKSAR government has stepped up the distribution of election-related information, including sending 3 million copies of the "Vote for Hong Kong and for yourself" booklet to every household through Hongkong Post, Lam said. It is hoped that the election will go smoothly and meet the public's expectations for an open, fair, honest, clean and efficient election, Lam said, calling on eligible electors to cast their ballots on the polling day. The LegCo election, the first since improvements to the HKSAR electoral system earlier this year, is of great significance, Lam said, adding that it will restore sound executive-legislative relationship and will be an important day for Hong Kong to move forward. The chief executive has specified Jan. 12, 2022 as the date on which the 2022 legislative session is to begin, and 11:00 a.m. local time of Jan. 12, 2022 as the time for holding the first meeting of the seventh LegCo. The LegCo election will see a total of 90 members, including 20 from geographical constituencies, 30 from functional constituencies, and 40 from the Election Committee constituency be returned.
