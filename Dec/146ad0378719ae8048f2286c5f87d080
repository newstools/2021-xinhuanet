YINCHUAN, Dec. 7 (Xinhua) -- Police in the city of Wuzhong, northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, have dismantled a money-laundering ring connected to more than 200 telecom and online fraud cases. More than 40 suspects were arrested in a police raid on Dec. 3. In October, local police determined that a suspect surnamed Ma had conducted illicit money transfers for fraud rings. Following a two-month investigation, police established a task force to crack the money-laundering ring that layered and transferred funds involved in fraudulent activities across the country involving over 20 million yuan (about 3.14 million U.S. dollars). Further investigation into the case is underway. Enditem
