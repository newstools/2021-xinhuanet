UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 16 (Xinhua) -- Flooding in South Sudan is increasing the risk of more displacements and further violence, endangering food security, and disrupting livelihoods, the United Nations (UN) said on Thursday. About 835,000 people in the country have been affected by flooding since May, said the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. More than 80 percent of those people affected are in the states of Jonglei, Unity and Upper Nile, the office said. Bentiu, capital of the oil-rich Unity State, faces the worst flooding in six decades, and more than 200,000 people in the state have been displaced and need assistance, according to the office. In the last 11 months, humanitarian agencies in South Sudan have fed 619,000 people and distributed emergency water, sanitation and hygiene relief to almost 477,000 people, and provided health services for 227,000 people, the office said. "Worrying levels of malnutrition among children under five were reported in the new settlement sites for internally displaced people (IDP)," it said, noting that there already are 2 million IDPs in the country.
