BEIJING, Dec. 17 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese mainland spokesperson on Friday slammed the provocative remarks made by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken against China. Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, made the remarks in response to Blinken's recent speech during his visit to Indonesia. Harboring the ill intention to contain China with Taiwan, certain individuals from the United States falsely blamed the Chinese mainland for tensions in the Taiwan Strait, and attempted to obstruct China's reunification and national rejuvenation in collusion with other forces, said Ma. Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party authority has obstinately sought "Taiwan independence" by relying on the United States and attempted to split the country with external support, which is the cause of tensions across the Strait, said Ma, adding that any such separatist act and provocation will be resolutely crushed.
