TAIPEI, Dec. 17 (Xinhua) -- All travelers to Taiwan are now required to conduct six COVID-19 tests in the first 22 days of their arrival, according to the island's disease monitoring agency. The requirement is part of new disease prevention measures adopted in response to a cluster infection at a quarantine hotel in the city of Taoyuan, the agency said on Thursday. The regulation applies to all arrivals, regardless of their vaccination status or choice of hotel quarantine plans, between Dec. 14 and Feb. 14, the agency added. Previously, travelers to the island were required to take only three or four COVID-19 tests, but that has changed after four people were identified as being part of a COVID-19 cluster infection at a quarantine hotel in Taoyuan on Thursday.
