BEIJING, Dec. 22 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank on Wednesday conducted a total of 20 billion yuan (about 3.14 billion U.S. dollars) of reverse repos to maintain liquidity in the banking system. The amount included 10 billion yuan of seven-day reverse repos at an interest rate of 2.2 percent, and 10 billion yuan of 14-day reverse repos at an interest rate of 2.35 percent, according to the People's Bank of China. The move was intended to maintain year-end liquidity in the banking system, the central bank said. A total of 10 billion yuan of reverse repos matured Wednesday. A reverse repo is a process in which the central bank purchases securities from commercial banks through bidding, with an agreement to sell them back in the future. Enditem
