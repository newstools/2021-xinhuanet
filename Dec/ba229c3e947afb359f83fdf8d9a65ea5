TAIPEI, Dec. 7 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan's exports to the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong rose to 17.14 billion U.S. dollars in November, up 18.9 percent year on year, according to data released by the island's finance authorities on Tuesday. The mainland and Hong Kong remained Taiwan's biggest export destination, accounting for 41.2 percent of the island's total exports in November. Taiwan saw a trade surplus of 5.71 billion U.S. dollars in November, and its trade surplus to the mainland was 9.07 billion U.S. dollars. During the first 11 months of this year, Taiwan's exports totaled 405.75 billion U.S. dollars, and imports increased to 346.23 billion U.S. dollars. The island's exports to the mainland and Hong Kong during the period reached a record 171.81 billion U.S. dollars, while imports hit 76.49 billion U.S. dollars. The island's finance authorities said that global economic recovery will continue to underpin Taiwan's exports later this year, but the spread of the COVID-19 variants and the supply chain bottlenecks may weigh on its exports.
