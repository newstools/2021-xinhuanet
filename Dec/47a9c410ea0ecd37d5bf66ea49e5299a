 A delegation of Chinese mainland Olympians concluded their three-day visit to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on Sunday. Among the 29 athletes and three coaches in the delegation, one speaks fluent Cantonese, a dialect prevailing in Hong Kong. That is sprint icon Su Bingtian. As a native of south China's Guangdong Province, in which Cantonese also prevails, Su said he grew up in an environment full of Hong Kong pop culture. Su set a new Asian record for the men's 100 meters in Tokyo with a run of 9.83 seconds. He said he hopes to do what he can to help with the development of sports in Hong Kong.
