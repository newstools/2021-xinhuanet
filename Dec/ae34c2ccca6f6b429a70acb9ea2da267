MACAO, Dec. 10 (Xinhua) -- China's Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) is holding three exhibitions to help expand business opportunities with online and offline matching platforms and facilitate coordinated development of industries. The 26th Macao International Trade and Investment Fair (MIF), the Macao Franchise Expo 2021 (MFE) and the 2021 Portuguese Speaking Countries Products and Services Exhibition (Macao) (PLPEX) opened Friday, combining the advantages of online and offline platforms to help traders seize business opportunities. The three-day exhibitions cover an area of over 28,000 square meters, up by 13 percent year-on-year. There are over 1,700 booths in total, an increase of about 40 percent over last year, with more than 920 on-site exhibitors and over 1,100 online exhibitors from China, Brazil, Portugal and Mozambique. Wu Zhiwei, CEO of Marmeleira Group that deals wine made by Portugal's centuries-old Quinta da Marmeleira, said their products have successfully taken the advantage of Macao's role of linking the Chinese mainland and Portuguese-speaking countries and tapped into the markets of Britain as well as the Chinese mainland and Macao. Yao Jincheng, CEO of Star Speed Store, a developer of delivery robots, said the company had secured orders with businesses in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries and Portuguese-speaking countries through last year's exhibitions thanks to the Macao SAR's links with these countries. The exhibition areas for technological innovation and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) this year attract over 145 scientific and technological innovation enterprises and 100 TCM businesses, showcasing scientific research results, and TCM products and services. The exhibitions also offer "remote exhibiting" services to allow enterprises and exhibitors from Portuguese-speaking countries that cannot attend the exhibition in person to showcase their products.
