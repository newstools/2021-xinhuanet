BENI, Dec. 25 (Xinhua) -- At least six people were killed in a suicide bomb explosion late Saturday, in the middle of Christmas celebration, in the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), said the local government. According to General Ekenge Sylvain, spokesman for the governor of North Kivu Province, at least six people, including the suicide bomber, were killed and 13 others wounded in this "terrorist attack." This tragedy took place "around 8 p.m. local time, at the entrance of a busy bar. The suicide bomber, stopped by the security guards from entering the bar crowded with customers, activated the bomb at the entrance of the bar," he said. "We call on the population to be vigilant by all means and to avoid crowded environments during this holiday season. In the city and territory of Beni, it is difficult, in these times, to know who is who. We all need to open our eyes and stay alert," he said in a statement. "The government condemns the explosion on Christmas of a bomb in a bar in Beni, the work of a suicide bomber. Loss of life is reported. The security services are already deployed," Congolese government spokesman Patrick Muyaya tweeted. In a communication on the radio without giving more details about the explosion, the Beni mayor asked the population to stay at home to allow the security and medical team to do their job to evacuate the wounded and secure the area of the attack. The provinces of North Kivu and Ituri, long troubled by insecurity, have been under siege since May 6 due to violence by armed groups, including rebels from the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF). Since Nov. 30, the Uganda People's Defense Forces, in collaboration with the Congolese army, has officially launched air and artillery operations against several ADF rebel positions in northeastern DRC. In June, two bomb blasts, including one carried out by a suicide bomber, hit on the same day the Beni city, causing at least one death and several injuries.  Enditem
