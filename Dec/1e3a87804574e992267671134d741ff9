ROME, Dec. 10 (Xinhua) -- Italy's industrial production surpassed pre-pandemic levels in October, though it fell slightly compared to the previous month when adjusted for seasonal factors, the country's statistics office said Friday. Seasonally adjusted production levels in October dropped 0.6 percent compared to September, though the levels were 0.7 percent higher than in February 2020 -- the last full month before the coronavirus pandemic began to negatively impact the Italian economy. According to the National Statistics Institute (ISTAT), data for industrial production in October was 2.0 percent higher than in October 2020, though part of that increase was due to October of this year including one extra working day compared to a year ago. The growth from last year was driven by a 3.4-percent increase in the production of intermediate goods (goods used to produce consumer products), a 2.7-percent increase in the production of consumer goods, and a 1.8-percent increase in energy production. The production of capital goods (tools used to produce consumer products) slipped by 0.1 percent, ISTAT said. Even though industrial production has recovered to pre-pandemic levels in Italy, the country's overall economy remains smaller. Italy's gross domestic product contracted by 8.9 percent in 2020, according to ISTAT data, while it is predicted to grow by 6.3 percent this year. Enditem
