SRINAGAR, Indian-controlled Kashmir, Dec. 20 (Xinhua) -- Indian army troopers were deployed at the main power stations in restive Indian-controlled Kashmir to restore electricity supply, officials said Monday. The move was taken in the wake of the ongoing strike of power development department (PDD) employees that entered the third straight day. Over 20,000 employees are on strike against the merger of the PDD into the Power Grid Corporation of India and the government's privatization plans of PDD's assets. The power outages have hit the region, leaving people at the receiving end amid harsh winters. Residents are complaining about the long power cuts and unresolved power faults. So far there has been no breakthrough in talks between the striking employees and the administration. The call for a boycott of work by PDD started on Friday night seeking administration to shelve the proposal. The standoff has come at a time when people in the region are heavily dependant on electricity for making heating arrangements to beat the cold. Enditem
