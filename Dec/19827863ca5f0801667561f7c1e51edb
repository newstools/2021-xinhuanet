BEIJING, Dec. 3 (Xinhua) -- China has tightened supervision over lawyers who formerly served in the country's courts and procuratorates, a move to prevent wrongdoings in the legal profession, said the Ministry of Justice. Legal professionals who are close relatives of court and procuratorate staff members are also under scrutiny, it added. A verification system, which includes information databases of the mentioned groups, has been established, said the ministry. The ministry will connect its verification system with the case filing systems of courts and procuratorates. This move will allow it to automatically identify situations where a former judicial or procuratorial staff member serves as a defense counsel or legal representative in violation of regulations.
