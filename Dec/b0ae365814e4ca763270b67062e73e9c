NEW DELHI, Dec. 22 (Xinhua) -- Both houses of the Indian parliament were Wednesday adjourned sine die, a day ahead of schedule, officials said. Speaker of the lower house of the parliament, locally known as Lok Sabha, Om Birla while giving an insight about the work of the winter session said a total of 99 lawmakers participated in the 12 hours and 26 minutes of discussion on the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Birla, the productivity of Lok Sabha in this winter session was approximately 82 percent. While 99 members took part in the debate on the pandemic, 61 members took part in the debate on climate change, which was inconclusive. Meanwhile, he said the session was disrupted for 18 hours and 48 minutes by opposition lawmakers on a variety of concerns, including price hikes and the violence in Lakhimpur Kheri, Uttar Pradesh. The upper house of the parliament, locally known as Rajya Sabha, witnessed disruptions throughout the session primarily over the suspension of a dozen lawmakers due to alleged unruly behavior during the previous monsoon session, local media reported. The main demand of the opposition was the revocation of the suspension of the 12 Rajya Sabha lawmakers, who had been engaged in a protest against their suspension beneath the statue of Mahatma Gandhi in the parliament premises. Chairman of Rajya Sabha Venkaiah Naidu said that the performance of the house in the winter session had been below expectation. "It could have been better. All need to introspect what went wrong. Rules, regulations, procedures, and precedents must be taken into account," he said. The winter session began on Nov. 29. Enditem
