BEIJING, Dec. 17 (Xinhua) -- A draft law on organized crime awaiting deliberation by China's top legislature has stipulated heavier penalties for organized crime involving minors, a senior legislator said Friday. The draft law will be tabled in the upcoming session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) for a third reading, said Yue Zhongming, spokesperson for the Legislative Affairs Commission of the NPC Standing Committee. The draft law will impose heavy penalties on those who involve minors in organized criminal gangs or overseas mafia organizations, abet or lure minors into committing organized crime, or commit organized crime against minors, said Yue.
