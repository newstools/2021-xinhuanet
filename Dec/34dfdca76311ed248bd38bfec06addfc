TOKYO, Dec. 17 (Xinhua) -- The Tokyo metropolitan government said Friday that a man in his 20s, confirmed to be infected with the Omicron variant of COVID-19, had visited a stadium near Tokyo to watch a soccer game. The patient, who has been hospitalized since Wednesday, is an acquaintance of a woman in her 20s who was confirmed infected with Omicron after arriving from the United States on Dec. 8. On Sunday, the man visited Todoroki Stadium in Kawasaki, Kanagawa Prefecture, to watch the Emperor's Cup semifinals, after meeting with the woman twice on two different days. The woman was hospitalized after testing positive for Omicron on Monday when she was in self-quarantine at home. The metropolitan government and the Kawasaki city government are asking about 80 other spectators seated around the infected man at the stadium and over 100 of his colleagues to go through testing for COVID-19. Moreover, Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike disclosed another Omicron case confirmed in the capital. When the infected person returned from overseas, he or she tested negative for COVID-19 at an airport last Saturday but began to show symptoms the next day.
