One people was injured in Mangarai district, East Nusa Tenggara province, and scores of houses were damaged in Selayar Island district, South Sulawesi province, Richard Elt, head of East Nusa Tenggara's emergency unit said. "The quake triggered panics. One man was wounded as he fell down when he was rushing outside a building. Our fellows in South Sulawesi informed us that scores of houses were damaged in the Selayar Island district," he told Xinhua by phone.
