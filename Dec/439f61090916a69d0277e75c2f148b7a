 A photo exhibition showcasing the changes of the Great Wall of China over the past 100 years is held in Jiayuguan City, northwest China's Gansu Province. The photos were taken by William Edgar Geil, a U.S. traveler, geographer and writer in the early 20th century, and William Lindesay, a British researcher who's been dedicated to protecting and studying the Great Wall for over three decades. Putting their pictures side by side, visitors could tell the changes of the national treasure of China in 100 years. The Great Wall of China is one of the world's great wonders. It was built during more than 2,000 years of continuous construction from the Spring and Autumn Period (770 BC-221 BC) to the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). The existing sections have a total length of over 21,000 km. China has been reinforcing the comprehensive protection of the UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Produced by Xinhua Global Service
