TBILISI, Dec. 13 (Xinhua) -- The so-called "Summit for Democracy" convened by the United States will definitely increase mistrust among countries and complicate global problems, an Armenian political expert has said. "I believe that the primary goal of the summit is the U.S. desire to establish a so-called alternative UN, where no country will have the veto power to oppose any U.S. decision or plans," Benyamin Poghosyan, chairman of the Center for Political and Economic Strategic Studies in Armenia, said in a written interview with Xinhua. Poghosyan criticized the U.S. administration's attempt to postpone the emergence of the multi-polar world order and extend the U.S. hegemony as long as possible through its "Summit for Democracy." The U.S. action to divide the world based on ideology will only increase mistrust among main international players and complicate global problems, he said. The global challenges, such as climate change and pandemics, require joint efforts of all major countries, "but these efforts can be launched only based on the win-win approach," he added. The expert suggested the United States focus its attention on solving its own deep-rooted problems such as racial and social inequality and the growing polarization between coastal megapolises and rural areas. The dispute over the 2020 presidential election results had shaken the foundations of the American democracy, he said. As for the definition of democracy, Poghosyan said he believes genuine democracy means dignity for the citizens and dignity in all spheres, namely to exercise rights and secure essential economic well-being.
