KHARTOUM, Dec. 31 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese police confirmed on Friday that four protesters were killed and hundreds injured during the mass demonstrations demanding civilian rule on Thursday in the capital Khartoum and its neighboring areas. "Four protesters were killed, while 297 others, along with 49 policemen, were injured in Omdurman," the Sudanese police said in a statement. Omdurman is the most populated city in Sudan and Khartoum State, lying on the western bank of the Nile river, opposite the capital Khartoum. The police accused the protesters of committing sabotage and attacking police forces that caused human losses and damage to public and private properties. Highlighting peacefulness, the police called for coordination with leaders of the protest in exposing those seeking to drive a wedge between the police and the people. Thousands of protesters took to the streets in Khartoum and other cities on Thursday in the 11th large-scale demonstration since Oct. 25 when the military suddenly moved to take over the country. Protesters in Khartoum tried to march toward the presidential palace but security forces fired heavy tear gases and water cannons to prevent them. Sudan has been suffering a political crisis since General Commander of the Sudanese Armed Forces Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan declared a state of emergency on Oct. 25 and dissolved the Sovereign Council and the government. On Nov. 21, Al-Burhan and then removed Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok signed a political declaration, which included reinstating Hamdok as prime minister, but the deal has so far failed to calm the street. The street protests were also fuelled by the rising prices of food, cooking gases and household essentials in the country.  Enditem
