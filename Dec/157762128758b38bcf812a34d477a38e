 PORTSMOUTH, Dec. 9, 2021 (Xinhua) --   A yellow warning for wind has been issued in Britain Tuesday as storm Barra has brought strong winds, heavy rain and snow to parts of the country. Storm Barra came just 10 days after Storm Arwen caused disruption and three fatalities across Britain. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Tuesday that the country must "learn the lessons for the future" and prepare for more storms as damaging as Arwen and Barra.
