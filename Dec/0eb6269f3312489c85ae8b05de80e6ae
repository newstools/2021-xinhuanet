HOUSTON, Dec. 3 (Xinhua) -- The first possible case of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 has been reported in the southern U.S. state of Louisiana, local authorities said on Friday. The case was reported to be someone in the Greater New Orleans area who recently traveled within the United States, said the Louisiana Department of Health and the City of New Orleans. "We now know Omicron is here in Louisiana. This is cause for concern, but not panic," said State Health Officer Joseph Kanter. "To all Louisianans, the single best action you can take to protect yourselves and your families is to get yourself and loved ones vaccinated and boosted if eligible," said Kanter. So far, the Omicron variant has been detected in more than 30 countries and at least nine U.S. states, according to an ABC News report. Enditem
