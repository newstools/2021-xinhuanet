 Stricter measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus will apply throughout Switzerland from Monday. Only people who have been vaccinated or have recovered from COVID-19 will be able to go inside restaurants, cultural, sporting and leisure venues and attend indoor events. The move is intended to reduce the risk of unimmunized people from becoming infected as they are also more likely to pass on the virus and become seriously ill.  Produced by Xinhua Global Service
