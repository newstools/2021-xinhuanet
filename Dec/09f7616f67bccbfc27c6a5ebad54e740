MANILA, Dec. 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian said on Friday that the Beijing Winter Olympics is a grand gathering of athletes and fans, not a political posturing and manipulation stage. When athletes and sports fans worldwide are looking forward to wonderful games, Huang expressed regret that certain countries politicize the Beijing Winter Olympics. "Those politicians want to engage in political manipulation or political shows, but they are completely looking for the wrong occasion," Huang said in a speech during a media reunion held in Manila. Huang said the detractors will not impact Beijing's success in hosting the Winter Olympics. "Beijing will become the world's first city to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics," Huang said, adding that under the guidance of the Olympic spirit and with concerted efforts, China will "deliver a streamlined, safe, and splendid Olympic Games for the world." For the coming Beijing Winter Olympics, the Philippines will be represented by its alpine skier Asa Miller who is going to compete in his second straight Winter Olympics. Nikki Cheng, president of Philippine Skating Union and member of Philippine delegation to Beijing Winter Olympics, said all athletes work hard for the event and the games should not be politicized. Although the Philippines is a tropical country, the Filipinos have a great passion for winter sports event, said Cheng. "When the skating ring reopens after the pandemic, we can further grow the winter sports," she said. Enditem
