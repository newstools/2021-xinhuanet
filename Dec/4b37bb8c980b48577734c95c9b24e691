SANAA, Dec. 10 (Xinhua) -- Yemen's Houthi militia said they shot down a "spy drone of the Saudi-led coalition" in the Yemeni central province of Marib on Friday. "We shot down the U.S.-made Scan Eagle drone belonging to the Saudi-led coalition in Sirwah frontline in the western part of Marib," the Houthi-run al-Masirah TV reported, citing a statement from the group's military spokesman Yehya Sarea as saying. In February, the Yemeni rebel group began a major offensive against the Saudi-backed Yemeni government army to capture the oil-rich province of Marib. Yemen has been mired in a civil war since late 2014 when the Iran-backed Houthi militia seized control of several northern provinces and forced the internationally recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi out of the capital Sanaa. The Saudi-led Arab coalition intervened in the Yemeni conflict in 2015 to support Hadi's government. Enditem
