FRANKFURT, Dec. 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Central Bank (ECB) said on Thursday that it will discontinue net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase program (PEPP) at the end of March 2022, according to the monetary policy decisions. The PEPP, a temporary asset purchase program of private and public sector securities as a key part of ECB's stimulus package to counter coronavirus risks and bolster the economy, was first launched in March 2020, with an initial overall envelope of 750 billion euros. The bond-buying program had been expanded twice last year before its ceiling was eventually raised to 1.85 trillion euros. In its monetary policy decisions, the ECB also confirmed "a lower pace" of net asset purchases in the first quarter of 2022, while deciding to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2024. The pandemic has shown that, under stressed conditions, flexibility in the design and conduct of asset purchases has helped counter the impaired transmission of monetary policy and made efforts to achieve the goal more effectively, the ECB said, yet without ruling out the possibility of resuming the emergency bond-buying program. "Net purchases under the PEPP could also be resumed, if necessary, to counter negative shocks related to the pandemic," it said. Enditem
