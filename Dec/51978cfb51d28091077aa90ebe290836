WASHINGTON, Dec. 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States has seen heightened gun violence in 2021, which exposed the country's deep-rooted social and political problems, the Cable News Network (CNN) has recently reported. The year of 2021 was a brutal year for gun violence in the United States, where more than two-thirds of the country's most populous cities have seen more homicides in 2021 than last year, according to a report by CNN on Tuesday. The toll of this violence isn't spread equally across the country. "Shootings, as well as the grief and trauma that come with it, are concentrated in lower-income, mostly Black and Latino communities in California, New Jersey, Louisiana and other states," The Guardian reported on Tuesday. This wave of spiraling violence became ever more difficult to address as the COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare all of society's inequities, CNN added.  Enditem
