GENEVA, Dec. 2 (Xinhua) -- "Without sustained and immediate action, 2022 could be catastrophic," the United Nations (UN) Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in its "Global Humanitarian Overview 2022" published on Thursday. "In Afghanistan, more than 24 million people require life-saving assistance to prevent catastrophe" caused by "repeated economic shocks, political tumult and the severe food insecurity caused by the worst drought in 27 years." According to the report, basic service delivery in Syria is "vastly inadequate and hampered by damaged infrastructure, lack of critical supplies and, increasingly, financial unaffordability. Average household expenditure now exceeds available income by 50 percent compared to 20 percent in August 2020." In Yemen, acute food insecurity affects 16.2 million people, and in Ethiopia 25.9 million people require humanitarian help. In Haiti, the report said, "43 percent of the population needs humanitarian assistance" as "the country is experiencing a profound and disturbing deterioration of the socioeconomic, political and security context coupled with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and a 7.2-magnitude earthquake." According to the latest UN assessment, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced an additional 20 million people into severe poverty, and up to 216 million people may have to be internally displaced by 2050 due to the effects of climate change. "Women and girls remain at increased risk of conflict-related sexual violence. Attacks against humanitarian workers and assets continue; 117 humanitarian workers were killed in 2020, 108 of whom were working in their own country," the report said. "Without sustained and immediate action, 2022 could be catastrophic," it said. Enditem
