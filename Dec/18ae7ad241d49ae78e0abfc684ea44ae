At a height of about 100 meters over the Yangtze River, a team of utility technicians worked six hours incessantly every day like "spider men", regardless of the winter coldness. The work of the "spider men" is part of the "Baihetan-Jiangsu" ultra-high-voltage (UHV) power transmission project. The 800-kilovolt, direct-current transmission project is celebrated as one of China's "power highways" and is an important part of the country's west-to-east power transmission program.
