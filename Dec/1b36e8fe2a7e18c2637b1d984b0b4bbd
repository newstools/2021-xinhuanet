ZAGREB, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States has a series of major problems with democratic standards, Croatian political scientist Davor Gjenero has said in a written interview with Xinhua. For a long time, the United States considers it has a monopoly on democracy, and it is supreme to decide whether a country is democratic or not. However, it all comes down to the interests of American politics regardless of whether Republicans or Democrats are in power, Gjenero noted. Today, the United States is losing its long-term vision of the development of democratic societies, and few people believe that the United States is at the forefront of democratic change that provides its citizens with more freedom and equality, Gjenero said. Moreover, the United States also has problem with the model of "exporting democracy," Gjenero said, adding that it has been proved to be tragic in Afghanistan, and the consequences will be felt by the Afghan people for years to come. Today, the U.S. arms industry certainly has an interest in exporting democracy by tanks and weapons, but it will no longer be a model that everyone in the world will accept, Gjenero said. Meanwhile, compared with the U.S. model of democracy, the Chinese model is simply great. "The country has a vision ... It is simply a professional model of the modern world," Gjenero stressed. The United States just does not want to admit that other countries are making incredible efforts in the development of democracy and have great results in this regard, Gjenero concluded. Enditem
