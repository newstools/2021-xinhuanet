TAIPEI, Dec. 8 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan's Consumer Price Index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, rose by 2.84 percent year on year in November, according to data released by the island's statistics agency on Tuesday. The figure marked a record high since February 2013, and was also above the 2-percent inflation warning line for the sixth time this year, said the agency. The agency attributed the CPI rise to increases in the prices of fuel, fruits, airfare, vegetables, restaurant food, house rent and meat. Consumer spending on transportation and communication increased the most in November, with the growth rate hitting 7.16 percent year on year. Enditem
