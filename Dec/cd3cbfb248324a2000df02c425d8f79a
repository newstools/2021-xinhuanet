CAIRO, Dec. 20 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian and Libyan Ministries of Manpower announced on Monday the launch of an electronic link system to organize the entry of Egyptian workers to the Libyan labor market. "The new system will coordinate the return of Egyptian labors to Libya to participate in the reconstruction projects of the war-torn country," Egypt's Ministry of Manpower said in a statement. The new system will document the exact number of Egyptian workers in Libya and their workplaces to protect their rights, the statement added. Libya has been the main destination for nearly 2 million Egyptian workers before the civil war that wreaked havoc in the country for a decade, Hamdi Imam, chairman of the Division of Recruitment Companies at the Cairo Chamber of Commerce, told Xinhua in a previous interview. Before the uprising and the killing of Libyan former leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, Egyptian workers were allowed to enter and reside there with Egyptian national IDs. Enditem
