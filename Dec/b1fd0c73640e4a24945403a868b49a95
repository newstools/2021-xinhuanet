NEW DELHI, Dec. 1 (Xinhua) -- Speculations are rife in the Indian media about a possible delay in resumption of international flights due to the new COVID-19 variant of Omicron. India declared last month to resume international flights from Dec. 15. "In the wake of the concerns sparked by the Omicron variant of coronavirus, India is unlikely to resume commercial international passenger flights from December 15 as had been decided earlier," said a report by India Today media group. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Wednesday said it was watching the situation closely in the wake of its decision to resume scheduled international passenger flights. "In view of the evolving global scenario with the emergence of new variants of concern, the situation is being watched closely in consultation with all stakeholders," the DGCA said in a statement. Scheduled international flights to and from India have remained suspended in India since March 23 last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Special international passenger flights have been operating since July last year under air bubble arrangements formed with 31 countries. The DGCA said: "An appropriate decision indicating the effective date of resumption of scheduled commercial international passenger services shall be notified in due course." On Nov. 28, the federal government said it would take a decision on the effective date to resume flights after reviewing the "evolving global scenario" over concerns relating to the Omicron variant of coronavirus. This decision of the Indian government came after the World Health Organization declared Omicron a variant of concern. Enditem
