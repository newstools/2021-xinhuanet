BERLIN, Dec. 16 (Xinhua) -- Vehicle manufacturers Daimler Truck and TRATON Group of Germany and Volvo Group of Sweden said Thursday they have signed a binding agreement to establish a joint venture (JV) to build a high-performance charging network for battery electric, heavy-duty long-haul trucks and coaches in Europe. The three companies are "committed to initiating and accelerating the necessary build-up of charging infrastructure for the increasing number of customers of electric vehicles in Europe and contribute to climate-neutral transportation in Europe by 2050," according to a joint statement. Daimler Truck, TRATON and Volvo plan to jointly invest 500 million euros (567 million U.S. dollars). According to the companies, this is "by far the largest charging infrastructure investment in the European heavy-duty truck industry to date." At least 1,700 high-performance green power charging points on and near highways as well as at logistics hubs and unloading points are to be set up and operated within five years of the JV's establishment, the companies said. The planned JV would operate independently and be based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. It would be held equally by each of the three parties and, following completion of all official approval procedures, is scheduled to start operations in 2022, according to the statement.
