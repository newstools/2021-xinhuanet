BEIJING, Dec. 18 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Education, together with eight other relevant authorities, has issued an action plan to address the draining talent pool of students and teachers in county-level regular senior high schools. By 2025, the gross enrollment ratio for senior secondary education will exceed 92 percent, and the dwindling pool of high-quality prospective students in county high schools will be addressed, according to the ministry. The action plan urges efforts to build a well-regulated enrollment mechanism with effective oversight. It also prohibits unfair cross-regional talent-poaching activities. The plan demands further efforts to replenish the teacher workforce, optimize the structure of teachers' allocations, enhance teachers' training and ensure proper treatment for teachers in county high schools. It also bans the irregular talent-poaching of teaching staff from schools in less developed areas to those in more developed ones. Enditem
