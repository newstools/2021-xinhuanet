ZAGREB, Dec. 6 (Xinhua) -- Croatia confirmed two cases of Omicron infection on Monday, but the source of the new COVID-19 strain remained to be identified. Both patients were interviewed in order to identify the source of the infection. However, the source was still unknown as the two patients did not travel outside of Croatia. They most likely got infected at one business meeting, said epidemiologist Bernard Kaic at a press conference. There were foreigners among the participants and so it is possible that one of them was the source, Kaic said, adding that 13 participants of the meeting had already been tested. However, Kaic said there is no need to change the existing rules regarding the COVID-19, meaning that only those contacts will be quarantined for 14 days. In the past few days, Croatia has seen a drop of daily new COVID-19 cases. Since Feb. 25, 2020, when the first case was confirmed in Croatia, a total of 631,765 people have been infected and 11,269 have died. Enditem
