ACCRA, Dec. 10 (Xinhua) -- France will support qualified Ghanaian small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to build capacity and take advantage of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) initiative, said a French diplomat Thursday. French Ambassador to Ghana Anne Sophie Ave said at a one-day business matchmaking event that France will help boost the capacity of qualified Ghanaian SMEs to upscale their businesses and benefit from the regional market. "We are eager to help SMEs, which have great ideas, to bring their services to scale and become more international to make the most of the AfCFTA opportunity. In the end, you are not going to look at a market of just 30 million people, but a market of several hundred millions people," Ave said. The beneficiary companies could use the investments to expand their production and create jobs across the value chains of their different sectors, Ave added. Enditem
