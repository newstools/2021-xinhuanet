MACAO, Dec. 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. "Summit for Democracy" is us-vs-them mentality possibly caused by domestic politics, further dividing the world at a time when global solidarity is in urgent need, said an editorial of the Macao Post Daily. The summit comprises only about half of the United Nations member states and excludes major countries like China and Russia, making it obvious that the Biden administration uses its own yardstick for what it regards as "democracy" as far as its list of about 110 invitees is concerned, said Harald Bruning, director of the English-language newspaper. Bruning noted, "ideologically and geopolitically motivated divisiveness is the last thing our planet needs right now." Enditem
