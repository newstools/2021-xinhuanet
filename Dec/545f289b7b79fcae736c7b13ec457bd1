HONG KONG, Dec. 18 (Xinhua) -- The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on Saturday announced that five persons, including Law Kwun-chung, are wanted for publicly inciting people to cast blank votes or not to vote at the Legislative Council (LegCo) election to be held on Dec. 19. The ICAC had earlier probed into the conduct allegedly breaching Section 27A of the Elections (Corrupt and Illegal Conduct) Ordinance (ECICO). In accordance with established procedures, the findings of the investigation were forwarded to the Department of Justice of the HKSAR government for legal advice, which considered that there was sufficient evidence to institute prosecution against the five persons. It is alleged that Sunny Cheung Kwan-yang, Lee Ka-wai, Lau Ka-man, and Lee Hin-long had allegedly engaged in illegal conduct by carrying out an activity in public, namely broadcasting through a social media platform a discussion amongst them, which incited others not to vote at the LegCo election. Law Kwun-chung had allegedly engaged in illegal conduct by carrying out an activity in public which incited others not to vote at the LegCo election. As the five persons had left Hong Kong, warrants for the arrest of them were issued by Magistrates' Courts upon applications made by the ICAC. So far, the ICAC has arrested 10 people for allegedly breaching Section 27A of the ECICO in relation to the 2021 LegCo election. Two of them were prosecuted, and seven others, including the above-mentioned five persons, are wanted. The relevant investigations are still on-going. Enditem
