 A video titled "Killing Machine" was posted on social media platforms overseas on Saturday. The video shows that the U.S. military, under the name of "anti-terrorism", has acted out of control with impunity in the 20-year war in Afghanistan. Is the U.S. really "fighting against terrorism"? Is this the democracy they have brought to Afghanistan? Click the video and take a look. (Video source: Youtube)
