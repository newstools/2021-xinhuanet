SRINAGAR, Indian-controlled Kashmir, Dec. 13 (Xinhua) -- At least two policemen were killed and 12 others wounded Monday evening after militants attacked their bus in restive Indian-controlled Kashmir, police said. The attack was carried out near Pantha Chowk area on the outskirts of Srinagar city, the summer capital of Indian-controlled Kashmir. "This evening militants attacked a police vehicle near Zewan in Pantha Chowk area of Srinagar, wounding 14 personnel. Of them, an assistant sub-inspector and a selection grade constable succumbed to their wounds, while 12 personnel are undergoing treatment in the hospital," a police official told Xinhua. Police officials said the bus was ferrying armed police personnel to the police camp in Zewan. Immediately after the attack, government forces rushed to the spot and cordoned off the area. Reports said searches were going on to trace the attackers. Earlier in the day, police claimed they have killed two militants in a gunfight in the Rangreth area of Srinagar city. Following the killings, clashes broke out between the police and government forces in the area. According to the police, government forces have not suffered any damage in the standoff. On Friday two policemen were killed in a militant attack in Bandipora town, about 55 km north of Srinagar. A guerilla war has been going on between militants and Indian troops stationed in the region since 1989. However, of late Indian policemen too have been trained to fight the militants. The militants often target government forces either with grenade attacks or live fire. The gunfight between the two sides takes place intermittently across the region. Kashmir, the Himalayan region divided between India and Pakistan, is claimed by both in full. Since their independence from Britain, the two countries have fought three wars, two exclusively over Kashmir. Enditem
