RAMALLAH, Dec. 20 (Xinhua) -- Palestine on Monday condemned the Israeli army's reported decision to allow Israeli soldiers to directly open fire at Palestinian stone throwers in the West Bank even after they run away. "The decision serves as a green light to commit more field executions against the Palestinians, according to the whims, moods, and assessments of the Israeli soldier," the Palestinian Foreign Ministry said in a press statement. On Sunday, Israel Radio reported that the Israeli army began to change the policy of opening fire in the West Bank in a way that allows shooting at anyone who throws stones and Molotov cocktails during clashes and after they escape. The radio added that the new instructions have come into effect in recent weeks through a document to all soldiers. The report also said that firing at stone and Molotov cocktail throwers "should be carried out in the clashes area, that is, immediately after the incident." The Palestinian statement said "the ministry is seriously considering the new decision, which represents a flagrant disregard for international humanitarian law and human rights principles." Enditem
