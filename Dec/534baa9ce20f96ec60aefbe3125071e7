UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations and its partners are continuing to provide winterization assistance across Afghanistan, said the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) on Monday. Last week, more than 81,000 people received such assistance in Nangarhar, Kunar and Nuristan provinces. Some 284,500 people received relief food assistance, and about 46,000 people in Paktya and Kabul provinces were reached with cash assistance, said OCHA. At the same time, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it provided 74 essential medicine items to the Chardehi Health Facility in Nangarhar Province. The assistance followed a joint visit to the facility to identify critical gaps in relief by the WHO, the public health department in Nangarhar and a nongovernmental organization. The Afghanistan flash appeal is 113 percent funded at 683 million U.S. dollars while the Afghanistan humanitarian response plan is 84 percent funded at 730 million dollars, OCHA said. Because of the deepening humanitarian crisis, the 2022 humanitarian response plan requirement has tripled to 4.47 billion dollars. Continued scaled-up support to Afghanistan is crucial to continue to save lives and the livelihoods of millions of people, it said. Enditem
