 A spectacular sunset was captured on Baiyangdian Lake, Xiong'an New Area, in north China's Hebei Province. On April 1, 2017, China announced plans to establish Xiong'an New Area, located about 100 km southwest of Beijing, aiming to build the 1,770-sq-km area into a green city featuring innovation and a national model of high-quality development. According to the Xiong'an development plan, forests, greenery and water bodies will make up 70 percent of the city's total area. All-out efforts have been made to restore the ecological environment of Baiyangdian Lake, an important wetland in the region. Over the past four years, local authorities have regulated more than 13,000 heavy-polluting enterprises, built new sewage treatment facilities and reduced fishery areas on the lake.
