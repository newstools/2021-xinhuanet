 Polls in the election for the seventh-term Legislative Council (LegCo) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) closed late Sunday, the first since improvement to the HKSAR electoral system. Voting ended at around 11:00 p.m. local time (1500 GMT), about half an hour later than originally scheduled due to technical glitches at 11 polling stations. More than 600 polling stations opened at 8:30 a.m. local time (0030 GMT) across Hong Kong for about 4.5 million registered electors to cast their votes. Voters followed anti-epidemic measures and practiced social distancing in a polling day that was orderly, smooth and safe. The membership of the seventh term of the HKSAR LegCo will increase from 70 to 90, and the members are elected by the Election Committee constituency (40 seats), functional constituencies(30 seats), and geographical constituencies (20 seats), respectively.
