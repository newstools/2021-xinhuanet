RAMALLAH, Dec. 10 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian demonstrator was killed on Friday by Israeli soldiers near the northern West Bank city of Nablus, Palestinian medics and eyewitnesses said. The Palestinian Ministry of Health said in a press statement that Jamil Abu Ayyash succumbed to his wounds in the hospital from a severe injury he had during clashes with Israeli soldiers in the village of Beita, south of Nablus. Palestinian paramedics said that Abu Ayyash was shot and critically wounded by Israeli soldiers who dispersed dozens of Palestinian demonstrators by live ammunition, rubber-coated metal bullets, and teargas canisters. They said that Abu Ayyash was critically wounded and was taken to Rafidia Hospital in the city, adding that dozens of demonstrators were injured by rubber bullets and others fainted after inhaling teargas. Palestinian eyewitnesses said that dozens demonstrated in the village on Friday afternoon in protest against Israeli settlement expansion and confiscation of lands, adding that an Israeli army force forcibly dispersed the demonstration. Meanwhile, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society said in a press statement that dozens of Palestinians were injured by Israeli soldiers during protests and clashes in several West Bank villages and towns. Every Friday, the Palestinians organize rallies and protests against the Israeli government's policies of expanding settlements and confiscation of lands. The demonstrations usually turn into clashes with the Israeli soldiers. Israeli settlement is the thorniest issue in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and one of the main reasons for stopping the last round of direct peace negotiations between the two sides in 2014.
