HELSINKI, Dec. 16 (Xinhua) -- Finnish greenhouse gas emissions totaled 48.1 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) in 2020, down by nine percent year-on-year, Statistics Finland said on Thursday. The accomplishment was significant for Finland as the emissions dropped by 4.7 million tonnes from 52.8 million tonnes in one year while the number was 2.2 million tonnes from 2015 to 2019, analysts noted. The fall was attributed to recent changes in the production structure of electricity and transport performance and the unusually warm winter, it said, noting that the decrease in industrial tree fellings from the previous year increased the net sink of the land-use sector (LULUCF). Statistics Finland concluded that on the basis of the data so far, Finland is meeting its emission reduction commitments under the European Union (EU) and the Kyoto Protocol for the 2013-2020 period. The energy sector is Finland's largest source of emissions, significantly affecting the annual variation of total emissions. According to the preliminary calculation, the sector's emissions totaled 34.6 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, 11 percent lower than in the previous year and 50 percent less than in the peak year of 2003. In a separate press release, Statistics Finland said that the share of renewable energy in total energy consumption in Finland reached 44.6 percent in 2020. Finland exceeded the target set in the EU's Renewable Energy Directive for increasing the use of renewable energy, according to Statistics Finland. Finland's national binding target is to achieve a share of at least 38 percent of the total final renewable energy consumption by 2020. In 2020, Finland's total consumption of energy amounted to 1.28 terajoules (TJ). The consumption fell by six percent from the previous year due to both the COVID-19 pandemic and exceptionally warm weather. The use of fossil fuels and peat decreased by 10 percent from the previous year, and their share of total energy consumption fell by two percentage points to 37 percent. Enditem
