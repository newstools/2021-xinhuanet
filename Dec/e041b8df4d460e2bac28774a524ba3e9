GAZA, Dec. 13 (Xinhua) -- The second phase of an Egyptian reconstruction plan has kicked off in the Gaza Strip to help rebuild the territory following an Israeli offensive earlier this year. Ibrahim al-Shuniqi, head of the Egyptian reconstruction committee, told Palestinian factions leaders and government officials that the start of the second phase in the Gaza Strip came under the directives of Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi. The Egyptian official, who chaired a delegation of engineers and construction experts, made the remarks during a ceremony held in Gaza City to celebrate the start of the second phase in the coastal enclave. "The political leadership's instructions are to provide assistance to Palestinian manpower and companies in Gaza that are capable of carrying out the work," al-Shuniqi said. On May 10, Israel waged a large-scale 11-day aerial offensive on the Gaza Strip, leaving more than 250 Palestinians and 13 Israelis killed as well as the destruction of buildings and other infrastructure. Egypt brokered a ceasefire agreement between Israel and militant groups led by the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas). It also pledged 500 million U.S. dollars in two phases to help rebuild the territory. Al-Shuniqi said that the first phase, which started after the end of the Israeli offensive, included the removal of rubble and debris. He added that the second phase will include constructing three housing projects in the Strip's center and north and two bridges in Gaza city, paving destroyed crossroads and building a corniche road.
