KINSHASA, Dec. 1 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) confirmed late Wednesday the presence of Ugandan armed forces in northeastern DRC to hunt down a notorious militia that both countries accuse of massacring civilians. Ugandan forces, in collaboration with the DRC's armed forces, on Tuesday morning launched artillery fire and air strikes against the Alliance of Democratic Forces (ADF) militia, DRC government spokesman Patrick Muyaya confirmed at a press briefing. These air strikes are targeted at the militia's camps located in a forest, not at any village nor city, said Leon Richard Kasonga, spokesman of DRC's armed forces, on Wednesday. It is currently impossible to determine how long the "concerted actions" against the militia would last due to "variables" and "changes," he added. Video footage shared on social media also showed advancing soldiers whose uniforms bore the Ugandan flag. The situation on the ground remains confused for the moment in the DRC, as the DRC government had on Monday refuted media reports since the weekend which claimed that Kinshasa had already granted access to Kampala's army in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri, where ADF rebels have been active in recent years. According to the DRC's media outlet Actualite.CD, this is not the first military intervention by Ugandan forces against the militia in the DRC's eastern city of Beni. In 2017, Uganda People's Defense Force claimed that it killed more than 100 ADF rebels during strikes in Beni. The DRC provinces of North Kivu and Ituri had been under a state of siege since May 6 due to violence by armed groups, especially the ADF rebels. Enditem
