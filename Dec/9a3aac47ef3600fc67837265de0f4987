WASHINGTON, Dec. 10 (Xinhua) -- The true death toll of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States could be 20 percent higher than the official figure, USA Today reported Thursday. "That's based on research showing that deaths attributed to COVID-19 do not account for all of the increased deaths in 2020 and 2021 when compared to prior years," said the report. "That means the number of Americans who have died from the virus could be closer to 1 million, not the roughly 793,200 deaths officially recorded as of Thursday," it said. Death rates among Native, Hispanic and Black Americans still far exceed pre-pandemic figures, whereas death rates of White Americans is expected to be closer to pre-pandemic levels this year, the reported said, citing data released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
