YAOUNDE, Dec. 14 (Xinhua) -- Communications regulators from the central African sub-region began meeting in Cameroon on Tuesday to deliberate on how to create a social media platform to fight hate speech and hostilities on social media. "With the advent of the social media, there are so many problems which cut across countries and with a united front we can put pressure on institutions like Facebook and YouTube to be able to help our wishes that we end up with a platform that brings together member countries of the central African sub-region," Joseph Chebonkeng Kalabubse, president of African Communication Regulatory Authority Network, who also doubles as president of the Cameroon National Communication Council told reporters at the start of deliberations in the seaside resort town of Kribi. "What we have learned from West Africa is that they have made concerted efforts to address problems which are transnational including how to handle the situation of hate speech, how to regulate the audio-visual sector," he added. Participants are hoping to launch a united plan of action on hate speech which will coordinate efforts across central African countries to identify, prevent and confront hate speech. Enditem
