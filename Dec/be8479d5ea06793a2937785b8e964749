PHNOM PENH, Dec. 20 (Xinhua) -- The election for the seventh-term Legislative Council (LegCo) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) will bring long-term peace, political stability, further development and prosperity to the city, a senior Cambodian official and an expert have said. The election, which kicked off on Sunday, was the first since improvements were made to the HKSAR electoral system. All the 90 members of the seventh-term LegCo of the HKSAR have been elected by Monday morning. Cambodian government chief spokesman Phay Siphan said that the election would strengthen unity of the people of the HKSAR and inspire a strong sense of patriotism among them. "The election will bring peace, coherence, political stability, further development and prosperity for the people of the HKSAR," he said, saying the new LegCo will serve the interests of the Chinese people. Kin Phea, director-general of the International Relations Institute at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, said the election is very important for the people of the HKSAR to exercise their due political rights. "This election also highlights the positive development of the democratization of the HKSAR, where people have the full right to govern their region, and thwarts external forces' attempt to bring the HKSAR into chaos," he stressed. The expert also noted that the "one country, two systems" principle " not only ensures the stability and prosperity of the HKSAR, but also lays a very solid foundation for democracy and harmony in the reigon."
