 Two freight trains departed from cities of Chengdu and Chongqing in southwest China respectively on Saturday, which marks the opening of a new cross-border logistics route of the New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor. Carrying light trucks, nuts, motorcycle parts, chemicals and other products, the trains will arrive in Lao capital Vientiane in around three days via the newly-launched China-Laos Railway. The railway started operation on Friday. The electrified passenger and freight railway runs 1,035 km, including 422 km in Laos, from the city of Kunming, southwest China's Yunnan Province, to Lao capital Vientiane. Before, it took seven to eight days to transport goods from Chengdu and Chongqing to Laos by land. The New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor is a trade and logistics passage jointly built by Singapore and provincial-level regions of western China.  Produced by Xinhua Global Service
