MOSCOW, Dec. 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States aims to draw a new dividing line in the world by hosting the so-called "Summit for Democracy," Igor Shatrov, head of the Expert Council of Russia's Strategic Development Fund, has said. The goals of the event are to create a platform completely under U.S. control, consolidate Washington's allies and "identify countries that they regard as enemies," Shatrov told Xinhua. The so-called summit targets the major geopolitical opponents and competitors of the United States, he added. "This has become a new tough challenge, a declaration of a new 'cold war' to everyone who does not accept unconditional American dominance, and who sees the world differently from the United States," Shatrov said. He believes that American democracy is going through a deep systemic crisis and that capitalism, after several centuries, has come to its logical end. "The modern world is not limited to the Western model. The search for new development models, both economic and political, has intensified in the world based on national values and traditions," he said, noting that such models more accord to the interests of the majority of a country. Shatrov suggested that countries developing in accordance with their national values and traditions should unite to defend their own values. Enditem
