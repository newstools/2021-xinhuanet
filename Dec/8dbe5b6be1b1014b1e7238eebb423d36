ISLAMABAD, Dec. 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Wednesday said that he wants to draw the international community's attention to the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan through a Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) meeting scheduled on Dec. 19. Qureshi said the monetary reserve of Afghanistan has been frozen, while the two years of drought in the country, high cases of COVID-19, and unavailability of salaries for government employees posed a difficult future for the Afghan people, adding that the advent of winter could aggravate the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, according to a statement from the foreign ministry. He urged the international community to understand that any chaos and "anarchy in the wake of the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan would lead to the strengthening of terrorist organizations." The foreign minister said that the OIC forum would offer an opportunity to foreign representatives of bridging the communication gap with the Taliban and listen to their point of view. Enditem
