MOSCOW, Dec. 9 (Xinhua) -- Many Americans are unwilling to change their behaviors to reduce the risk from the new COVID-19 variant Omicron, Russian broadcaster RT reported, citing a recent poll. The Axios-Ipsos survey showed that 33 percent of 1,021 respondents were willing to stop dining indoors at restaurants, while only 13 percent were willing to work remotely from home. Less than 30 percent of the respondents were ready to give up gathering with other households, and just 23 percent said they might cancel holiday trips. In line with previous polls, Republicans were much less willing to change their personal behaviors than Democrats. Enditem
