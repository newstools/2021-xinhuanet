YAOUNDE, Dec. 13 (Xinhua) -- Set to host the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) next month, Cameroon conducted a series of security drills on Monday in restive English-speaking region of Southwest to prepare against terror attacks ranging from an explosion to a hostage situation. Soldiers, policemen, firemen and medical personnel were among participants of the exercise, held at the Limbe Omnisport Stadium that will host Group F matches including Tunisia, Mali, Mauritania and Gambia. During the mock exercise, terrorists detonated an improvised explosive device in the stadium during a match and took hostage people and tried to escape before being gunned down by security and defence forces. "The exercise that has been carried was a kind of demonstration of force. The various participants can be sure that the security aspect of the field is assured. To an extent, we can say that we are prepared," said Ignatius Akuni, a military official. The Southwest region is notorious for frequent detonation of improvised explosive devices. Separatist fighters who want to create an independent nation in Cameroon's two Anglophone regions of Northwest and Southwest have threatened to disrupt AFCON in the region. Last month, Cameroon's defence minister, Joseph Beti Assomo said they were taking the threat seriously and "will take appropriate measures". AFCON is scheduled to take place in Cameroon from January 9 to February 6 next year. Enditem
