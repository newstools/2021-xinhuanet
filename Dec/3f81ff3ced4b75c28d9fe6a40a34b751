HAVANA, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- Cuba held its National Craft Fair in the country's capital city of Havana on Sunday, with mask mandates and COVID-19 protocols in place. It was the first time that artisans from across the country had come together since the pandemic began on the island in March 2020. Among the artisans is Cuban artisan Aylette Ceballo, who has crafted iron furniture, decorative pieces, and accessories over the past two decades. "This is a platform for artisans to sell their works. I was eager to put my new pieces before the public eye," she told Xinhua. The event, which runs through Dec. 19, features multiple handmade crafts including wooden furniture, textiles, artisanal soaps, glass art, footwear and paintings. "We sell a wide variety of wooden items for home as well as ornamental plants," Ernesto Perez said, who is the director-general of the virtual shop Alcansan. "This is very positive for increasing our earnings." Hosted by the Cuban Fund of Cultural Goods (FCBC), the event is aimed at promoting local commerce and reconnecting artisans with the public, according to organizers. Participants were also required to wear face masks with COVID-19 protocols in place, organizers said. Denisse Gonzalez, head of public relations of the FCBC, told Xinhua that all craftworks on show were for sale. This year's edition includes more than 150 exhibition stands representing state institutions, private entrepreneurship and independent artists. Mireya Perez, a 68-year-old Havana resident, told Xinhua that she would have wanted to buy more craftworks had she had more money. "I bought a painting, a glass lamp as well as a leather belt for my husband," she said. "I feel satisfied with my purchases." Enditem
