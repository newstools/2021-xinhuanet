KHARTOUM, Dec. 26 (Xinhua) -- Sudan on Sunday condemned the Friday looting of the base of the outgoing United Nations- African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID), which left one person dead. "We condemn in the strongest terms the attacks on and looting of the UNAMID camp in El Fasher on Friday," the Sudanese Foreign Ministry said in a statement, adding the attackers looted some equipment donated by the mission to the government of Darfur states. The statement voiced Sudan's commitment to provide necessary protection for the UNAMID camp, its assets and all international staff until the mission's final exit. In December last year, the UN Security Council terminated UNAMID's mandate. The United Nations has donated the assets of UNAMID to the local governments in the Darfur regions for civilian use.
