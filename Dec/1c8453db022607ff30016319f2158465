HONG KONG, Dec. 21 (Xinhua) -- The new listings market of the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) had a robust year, with 92 listings raising 318.9 billion Hong Kong dollars (about 40.88 billion U.S. dollars) through Dec. 17. While the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact global economies, Hong Kong's financial markets have remained vibrant, resilient, and robust, the HKEX said in a statement on Tuesday. In 2021, HKEX welcomed 54 new economy companies, including 32 healthcare and biotech firms, accounting for 86.6 percent of initial public offering (IPO) funds raised in Hong Kong during the period. Average daily turnover in HKEX's cash equities market rose 32 percent from a year earlier, and the average daily volume of HKEX's derivatives market recorded a 3-percent increase year-on-year. During the year, HKEX further expanded its product offering and strengthened its role as a gateway to China for global investors. Notable initiatives included Hong Kong's first A-share derivatives product -- MSCI China A 50 Connect Index Futures -- which was introduced in October, becoming the best ever futures product launch for HKEX, said the statement. HKEX Chief Executive Officer Nicolas Aguzin said: "I am as excited about the opportunities for HKEX as I was when I first joined -- the road ahead for us, and for Hong Kong's financial services industry, is full of possibilities." "I believe HKEX is well-positioned to play an increasingly important role in the fast-evolving, interconnected global capital markets of the future, by promoting better connectivity and understanding between companies and stakeholders across different countries and markets, funding the businesses of the future, creating jobs and supporting communities that shape our future," he said.
