MOSCOW, Dec. 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States has failed to build democracy at home, but is very zealous to do it in other countries, First Deputy Secretary of the Russian Security Council Yuri Averyanov has recently said. "There is a saying in Russia that those who cannot do something themselves teach others instead. This is what the United States is doing," Averyanov told the Russian government's official newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta after the so-called "Summit for Democracy" led by the United States. American elites sought to persuade themselves that the United States is still the only superpower, that its global dominance is unchallengeable, and that the entire world stands with Washington only, he added. The U.S. leadership "can only play ideological games," Averyanov said. Enditem
