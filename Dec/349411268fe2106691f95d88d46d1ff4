LANZHOU, Dec. 1 (Xinhua) -- A notable national treasure, popularly known as "Bronze Galloping Horse Treading on a Flying Swallow," will go on display in northwest China's Gansu Province next year. Making the announcement on Wednesday, the Gansu provincial museum said the bronze statue, a cultural relic under China's highest national-level protection, will be put on display from May 1 to Oct. 15 every year in the museum starting from 2022.
