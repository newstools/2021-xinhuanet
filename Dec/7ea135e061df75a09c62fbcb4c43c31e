The event, which will run until March 11, features more than 60 artists from around the world, including 27 Saudi artists, 12 Chinese artists, and artists from Europe, Africa, and Latin America, according to the Diriyah Biennale Foundation, which was set up by the Saudi Ministry of Culture in 2020 to organize the event.
