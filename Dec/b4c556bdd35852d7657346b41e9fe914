The listing is a recognition of Syria's cultural legacy, the ministry said in a statement. The UNESCO announced on Wednesday to inscribe the Qudud Halabiya music on the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity Wednesday. Qudud Halabiya, which literally means music from Aleppo, is a form of traditional music with a fixed melody. Singers of Qudud Halabiya often improvise lyrics according to what is happening around them. The UNESCO hailed the musical genre as "a vital part of Aleppan culture" and "a source of resilience, particularly during war."
