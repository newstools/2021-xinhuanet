LUSAKA, Dec. 10 (Xinhua) -- Zambia was deliberating on the possibility of introducing COVID-19 booster vaccines to improve the protection of citizens, Zambian Health Minister Sylvia Masebo said on Friday. Technical experts are currently holding consultations on the issue and the government will soon provide related policy recommendations, the minister said. COVID-19 booster vaccines will be procured upon the policy recommendations by a technical working committee and will aim to ensure the vaccination of 70 percent of the eligible population aged 18 and above, the minister told a parliament session. The decision on whether to administer booster vaccines or not will take into account individual risk groups, vaccine availability, vaccination coverage, among others, she added.
