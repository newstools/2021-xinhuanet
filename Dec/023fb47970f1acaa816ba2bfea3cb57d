BEIJING, Dec. 21 (Xinhua) -- China's Supreme People's Court (SPC) on Tuesday issued a guideline on further improving supervision over the enforcement of court judgments. The 43-article document stresses the need to push forward the separation of judicial power and enforcement power. It also highlights the need to intensify the supervision over the enforcement of judgments, and streamline the enforcement mechanism. It also proposes measures to boost the transparency of enforcement cases, such as optimizing the enforcement information disclosure platform, to guarantee the rights of the parties concerned and the public to know of, participate in and supervise these cases. From 2019 to November 2021, courts across the country opened 33.2 million enforcement cases and concluded 29.6 million cases, according to the SPC. Enditem
