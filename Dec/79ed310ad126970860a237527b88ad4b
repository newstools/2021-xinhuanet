BEIJING, Dec. 16 (Xinhua) -- An international group of scientists has made a global assessment of rice cropping systems to explore opportunities for improving rice production. Researchers from China, the United States, Brazil, Indonesia, India, Uruguay and several global research institutes assessed rice yields and efficiency in using water, fertilizer, pesticides and labor across 32 rice cropping systems that accounted for half of the global rice harvest area. According to the results published in Nature Communications, there is still substantial room to increase rice production and reduce the negative environmental impact. Enditem
