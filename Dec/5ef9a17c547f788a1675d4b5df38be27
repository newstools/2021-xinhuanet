ZAGREB, Dec. 21 (Xinhua) -- The Croatian Constitutional Court ruled on Tuesday that the anti-pandemic measures adopted by the government are legitimate and in accordance with the Constitution. "The aim of the measures is to protect patients and social welfare workers working in these institutions and to reduce to the minimum the risk of infection," the court said in a statement. The statement said that the Civil Protection Headquarters, the Croatian agency in charge of the COVID-19 regulations, is obliged to adopt measures it deems least restrictive on the one hand and protects public health from the pandemic on the other, on the basis of available scientific knowledge at the time of enactment of such measures. Meanwhile, the court urged the Civil Protection Headquarters to explain new anti-pandemic measures to the public in the future. On Nov. 16, the Croatian government introduced mandatory COVID-19 certificates for access to public or state institutions and schools. The certificates are issued to those who have been vaccinated, recovered from the virus, or tested negative. However, the introduction of the certificates has provoked protests across the country and claimed by the opposition parties to be unlawful. Enditem
