KIEV, Dec. 6 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov has called on three Western countries, namely the United States, Canada and Britain, to step up their military support for Kiev, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reported on Monday. In an interview with the online media outlet The Globe and Mail, Reznikov stressed that Ukraine needs additional assistance to upgrade its air defense system and naval fleet in the wake of the alleged Russian military buildup along the Ukrainian border. Besides, Reznikov urged the United States, Canada and Britain to expand their military training missions in Ukraine and deploy their soldiers in certain locations near the Russian border. Ukraine and some Western countries said that Russia was "amassing troops and military equipment" on the border with Ukraine. However, Moscow has repeatedly said it has no plan to invade Ukraine. Since April 2014, the conflict between government troops and local armed groups has been raging in eastern Ukraine, claiming some 14,000 lives. Kiev has received security aid from the United States worth about 2.5 billion U.S. dollars since the beginning of the conflict. Meanwhile, British and Canadian military instructors have trained thousands of Ukrainian servicemen as part of their operations Orbital and UNIFIER. Enditem
