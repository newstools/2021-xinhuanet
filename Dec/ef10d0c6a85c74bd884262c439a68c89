BEIJING, Dec. 15 (Xinhua) -- China's industrial production continued to expand in November, with the high-tech manufacturing sector posting strong performance, official data showed Wednesday. China's value-added industrial output, an important economic indicator, went up 3.8 percent year on year in November, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed Wednesday.

Specifically, the output of new energy vehicles logged a marked increase of 112 percent in November, while that of industrial robots and integrated circuits jumped 27.9 percent and 11.9 percent year on year, respectively. In a breakdown by ownership, the output of state-owned enterprises rose 3.6 percent from a year earlier, and the private sector's output increased 3.9 percent. The industrial output is used to measure the activity of designated large enterprises with an annual business turnover of at least 20 million yuan (about 3.14 million U.S. dollars). During the first 11 months of the year, the value-added industrial output rose 10.1 percent from a year ago. The figure puts average January-November growth for the past two years at 6.1 percent, NBS data showed. Profits of China's major industrial firms surged 42.2 percent year on year in the January-October period to top 7.16 trillion yuan, NBS data showed. Enditem
