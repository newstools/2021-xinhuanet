BAGHDAD, Dec. 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi and British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss on Monday discussed ending the combat role of the U.S.-led coalition forces in Iraq. Al-Kadhimi received a phone call from Truss, and the two discussed the coordination between Baghdad and London regarding ending the combat role of the U.S.-led coalition forces and shifting to advise and support role to enhance security and stability in Iraq and the region, a statement by al-Kadhimi's media office said. The two sides also discussed the cooperation between the two countries in the war against the militants of the extremist Islamic State (IS) group, and the means to boost bilateral ties in various fields, the statement said. On Nov. 24, Tahseen al-Khafaji, spokesman of the Iraqi Joint Operations Command, said the foreign combat forces would leave Iraq within 15 days, except for some advisers who will stay to support the Iraqi forces. "Ending the presence of the foreign forces is proceeding according to the plan, and there is no military base for them except for limited presence in Ayn al-Asad Air Base in the western province of Anbar," al-Khafaji said. On Jan. 5, 2020, the Iraqi parliament passed a resolution requiring the government to end the presence of foreign forces in the country. In July this year, the United States and Iraq held a session of strategic dialogue, during which the two countries agreed on withdrawing all U.S. combat troops from Iraq by Dec. 31. Enditem
