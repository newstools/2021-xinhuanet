SYDNEY, Dec. 13 (Xinhua) -- Australian states are pushing ahead with loosening restrictions for travellers, despite rising COVID-19 infections. The state of Queensland, a hot tourist destination, has ceased the border closure to the two most populous states, New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria, which reported 536 and 1,290 new COVID-19 cases respectively on Monday. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk brought forward the reopening as the state would hit 80 percent double-dose vaccination ahead of schedule. From 1:00 a.m. on Monday, fully vaccinated travellers from interstate coronavirus hotspots like NSW, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) are allowed to enter Queensland without quarantining for 14 days, but they must return a negative COVID-19 test within the 72 hours before arrival and get tested five days after arriving in the state. Meanwhile, the state of Victoria scrapped the quarantine requirement for fully vaccinated travellers from South Africa, where the Omicron variant was first detected. Fully vaccinated travellers from eight southern African countries including South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Malawi, and Mozambique will no longer have to undertake 14-day mandatory hotel quarantine when they arrive in the state. These travellers, if fully vaccinated, or if at the ages of 2 months to under 12 years, could self-quarantine at home or private accommodation for 72 hours, get tested within 24 hours of arrival, get tested again between days 5 and 7 after arrival, and observe restrictions on entering sensitive settings.
