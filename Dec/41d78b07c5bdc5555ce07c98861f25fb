SAO PAULO, Dec. 11 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's Federal Supreme Court (STF) determined on Saturday that all foreigners entering the country should present a certificate verifying that they have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The decision was made at the request of the Brazilian political party Sustainability Network given the federal government's decision to allow unvaccinated people to enter the country with a five-day quarantine. The STF's policy came into effect on Saturday. Until then, Brazil had required a negative PCR test to enter the country. More than 65 percent of the Brazilian population has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Brazil is among the countries hardest hit by COVID-19 worldwide, ranking second only after the United States in terms of death tolls, and third in terms of caseload after the United States and India.
