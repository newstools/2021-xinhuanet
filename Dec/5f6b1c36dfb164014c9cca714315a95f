SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. city of San Francisco announced the cancellation of the city's annual New Year's Eve fireworks show as holiday gatherings and travel have expedited the spread of the COVID-19 Omicron variant. The event could draw tens of thousands to the waterfront, creating a hotbed for viral infections, public health officials said Tuesday, adding that another big worry is a shortage of staff to handle large events. New Year's Eve already presents challenges for San Francisco's police and fire departments, given the number of parties and revelers, according to a report by San Francisco Chronicle. As of Tuesday, 84 percent of eligible San Francisco residents are vaccinated and 55 percent have received a booster shot, officials said in a news release.  Enditem
