MOSCOW, Dec. 9 (Xinhua) -- Washington seeks to establish a broad coalition of "friends against foes" by promoting the so-called "Summit for Democracy," the Russian Foreign Ministry said Thursday. "Democracy, in the context of this summit, is used merely as a code word," the ministry's spokesperson Maria Zakharova told a weekly briefing. She said that the United States is destroying the world order rooted in international law and is taking advantage of the chaotic situation it has created by hosting the so-called summit or a "new game," where Washington tries to engage as many as possible that would serve its interests. "This is sad. This is a new dividing line, a new type of segregation," she pointed out, adding that the United States has unfortunately failed to learn from its past mistakes. Enditem
