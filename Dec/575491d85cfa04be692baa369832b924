HARARE, Dec. 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe on Thursday signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Rwanda on the exchange of educational personnel. The agreement is designed to protect citizens from the dangers of unethical and unfair recruitment practices for human capital across national borders and explore African solutions to challenges, Paul Mavhima, Zimbabwe's minister of Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare, said at the signing ceremony. "I have no doubt this MOU shall indeed be a template of good practice across the continent of Africa and beyond," Mavhima said. Necessary pre-departure training of the selected personnel will be conducted to ensure that they easily fit and adjust to the working life in Rwanda, he said. The signing of the agreement came after Rwandan President Paul Kagame indicated earlier in October that his country was willing to recruit Zimbabwean teachers.  Enditem
