RABAT, Dec. 20 (Xinhua) -- The Moroccan security aborted an international drug trafficking operation and seized three tonnes of cannabis, official news agency MAP reported on Monday. The operation occurred on Sunday night near the central city of Taroudant, the report said. The banned substance was concealed in 90 bags inside a car, it said, adding that a speedboat and two outboard motors were seized. One individual, aged 37, who was wanted for his involvement in international drug trafficking, was arrested, it added.
