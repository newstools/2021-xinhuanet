BEIJING, Dec. 17 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese mainland spokesperson on Friday demanded the U.S. Congress to stop its wrong acts concerning Taiwan to avoid bringing further damage to the peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, urged the U.S. government and relevant departments to stop any form of military ties with China's Taiwan region, as well as give up their dangerous attempt at obstructing China's reunification through military support to Taiwan. Ma made the remarks when responding to a media query regarding the U.S. National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022. Some anti-China forces and Congress members of the United States turned to using Taiwan as a pawn to curb China's development and national rejuvenation, Ma said, calling their moves "playing with fire," which are doomed to fail. Ma also warned Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party authority that colluding with external forces and using military means to reject reunification will only push Taiwan into disasters. Enditem
