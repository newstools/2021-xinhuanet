NEW DELHI, Dec. 23 (Xinhua) -- At least two persons were killed and four others injured in a blast in India's northern state of Punjab on Thursday, said a state government official. The blast took place inside a court complex in the state's Ludhiana district. The explosive material was reportedly kept inside a bathroom. Following the blast, walls of the bathroom were damaged and window glasses shattered. According to media reports, there was a lawyers' strike at the court, and hence only a few people were present in the premises when the blast took place. Soon after the blast, a high alert was sounded across Punjab, and police were directed to tighten security at public places.  Enditem
