(Xinhua/Li Bo) NANJING, Dec. 21 (Xinhua) -- China's Jiangsu Province handled more than 1,600 China-Europe freight train trips in the first 11 months of the year, up 32.76 percent year on year, Nanjing Customs said Monday. During the January-November period, the freight trains carried 101,500 20-foot equivalent units (TEU) of goods, up about 50 percent from a year ago. The province has added seven new China-Europe freight train routes since this year, including the Suzhou-Helsinki and the Nanjing-Tilburg freight train services, bringing the total number of such routes to 19 and covering more than 10 countries in Central Asia, Europe and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The Nanjing Customs has applied a logistics information management system for freight trains, which greatly streamlines customs declaration and approval. China put into operation the China-Europe freight train service in 2011, which has since served as a crucial link for trade and economic cooperation across the Eurasian continent.  ■
