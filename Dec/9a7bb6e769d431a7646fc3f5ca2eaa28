RAMALLAH, Dec. 22 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Tuesday called on Israel to implement the agreements it signed with Palestine and resume the Middle East peace process, which has been stalled for seven years. Abbas made the remarks during a meeting with Acting Assistant Secretary of the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs Yael Lempert in the West Bank city of Ramallah, Palestine's official news agency WAFA reported. WAFA said that Abbas briefed Lempert over the latest developments in the Palestinian territories, mainly Israel's unilateral practices against the Palestinians that undermine the world-backed two-state solution. Abbas told Lempert that it is necessary to stop the Israeli measures and implement the agreements signed between the two sides to start a real political process based on implementing the international resolutions. Abbas' meeting with Lempert came one day before his meeting with U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, who arrived in Israel on Tuesday to discuss several issues, including the revival of the stalled peace process. Direct peace talks between Israel and Palestine came to a halt in late March of 2014, following deep differences on issues such as Jewish settlements and the recognition of a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders.
