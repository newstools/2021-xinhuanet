 A new bridge on a sea-crossing high-speed railway connecting the cities of Fuzhou and Xiamen in east China's Fujian Province was joined together on Saturday. The Meizhou Bay cross-sea bridge is one of the major parts of the 277-km Fuzhou-Xiamen high-speed railway which is under construction. The length of the bridge is about 14.7 km, and its builder said it is the country's first extradosed cable-stayed bridge on a sea-crossing high-speed railway. With a designed speed of 350 km per hour, the high-speed railway is expected to slash the travel time from the province's capital Fuzhou to the tourist attraction Xiamen within one hour.
