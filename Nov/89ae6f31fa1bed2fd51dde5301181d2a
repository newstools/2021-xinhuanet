 Rural vlogger "Student Zhang" posted his first online video on Oct. 4th this year. Now he has accumulated about six million fans on online video-sharing platforms Douyin (Chinese version of Tiktok) and Kuaishou within less than two months. Documenting his daily routine, but filming professionally, the popularity of "Student Zhang" is quite similar to that of China's top online celebrity Li Ziqi. It's believed both Li Ziqi and "Student Zhang" offer a window to a life that many urban people yearn for but lack the courage to pursue. One comment says, "I don’t know why I'm enthralled by his videos, I just can't stop browsing them."
