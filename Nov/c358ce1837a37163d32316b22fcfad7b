LAGOS, Nov. 7 (Xinhua) -- Three people were killed and two injured in an accident involving a truck and two other vehicles in the southwestern state of Ogun, road police said on Saturday. The accident occurred on a busy expressway when a Toyota Camry car with no registration number wrongfully overtook a truck loaded with empty crates, causing the truck driver to lose control and ram into a Toyota Sienna in front, said Babatunde Akinbiyi, spokesperson for the Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps based in Ogun, in a statement. "The Toyota Camry car which caused the accident escaped," he said, adding the injured were taken to a local hospital for treatment. In Nigeria, fatal road accidents are frequently reported, often caused by overloading, poor road conditions and reckless driving. Enditem
