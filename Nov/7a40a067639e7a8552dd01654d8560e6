(Xinhua/Han Yan) HONG KONG, Nov. 12 (Xinhua) -- China's actions speak louder than words, and it's inspiring other developing countries during its transition to a carbon-neutral economy, said an opinion piece by the South China Morning Post recently. "Beijing's value-add to the COP26 process really derives from the strategy China has adopted to achieve a carbon-neutral economy before 2060, a succession of practical measures that might well prove an attractive template for other developing nations," said the article.

(Xinhua/Han Yan) China has set out a strategy to peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, a process that will require the country to meet a number of significant milestones along the way. The article also pointed out that China has taken practical measures that "provide a road map for moving gradually from overall fossil fuel dependency to carbon neutrality, while still staying on a pathway to greater economic prosperity."  ■
