WASHINGTON, Nov. 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States is "becoming an increasingly antidemocratic country," Ja'han Jones, a writer for The ReidOut Blog, a digital extension of an MSNBC program, has recently written. Jones reached the conclusion based on what he described as "conservative attacks" on the country's elections. The writer cited a recently published report, in which the United States has been added to a list of "backsliding democracies." The report, according to Jones, pointed to former U.S. President Donald Trump's refusal to accept his 2020 election loss as a "historic turning point" in American democracy. The report also said Trump's actions were a sign of America's "democratic backsliding." Enditem
