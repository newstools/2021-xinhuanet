BEIJING, Nov. 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Supreme Court seemed poised to ease gun control regulation, and it may cause problems for the U.S. society, The Guardian has recently reported.

CNN reported that 14,516 people died from gun violence in the United States between Jan. 1 and Sept. 15 this year, a 9-percent increase compared to the same period of time in 2020, according to The Guardian.
