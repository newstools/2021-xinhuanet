CAPE TOWN, Nov. 26 (Xinhua) -- Anwar Adams, councillor of South Africa's legislative capital Cape Town, on Thursday evening said the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) boosts the exchanges between the youths of China and South Africa. The relations between China and South Africa have gotten better under the FOCAC, and he is expecting the relations going from strength to strength, Adams told Xinhua in an interview on the sidelines of the opening ceremony of the Chinese Bridge Club in Cape Town. Through the FOCAC, the youths on both sides can share experience and cultures, which opens up an opportunity and puts in place the legacy for the youths and the future, according to the councillor.
