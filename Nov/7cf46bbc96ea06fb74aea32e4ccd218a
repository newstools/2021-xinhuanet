 SHIJIAZHUANG, Nov. 6 (Xinhua) -- With a coal mining history of over 100 years, Tangshan City in Hebei Province was once plagued by serious soil erosion. In recent years, the city has launched ecological restoration projects including tourism development in mining areas to boost green shift in the energy industry. Tangshan Huahai project was once a coal mining base, putting enormous pressure on the environment. To promote sustainable development, the local government in 2018 issued new policies to build a garden valley in the mining areas. The base has now been covered by green coats, with the afforestation rate hitting about 85 percent. Entertainment, film and sports industries have also taken roots, giving vitality to the once barren land. Many mining areas in the city are undergoing tremendous changes. From wasteland to wonderland, the city's greening journey has changed locals' life, a manifestation of China's ecological growth.
