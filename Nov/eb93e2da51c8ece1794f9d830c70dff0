 A video platform uploader in China has recently designed and created a customized gaming nursing bed for a severely paralyzed former firefighter. Zimujun is an uploader concentrating on digital products review and furniture transformation on Bilibili, a popular video streaming and sharing platform in China. Zhu Mingjun is a former firefighter. He was paralyzed from his neck down due to a serious fall on July 9, 2013. Now he has to rely on a respirator to help him breathe. Zhu is now a certified psychological consultant, and he also does video-game streaming on Bilibili during his spare time. For Zimujun, it's quite a challenge because it was the first time for him to make a customized product for a person with a disability. To perfect the design, Zimujun had repeated discussions with Zhu. Two months later, the bed was finally completed.  Produced by Xinhua Global Service
