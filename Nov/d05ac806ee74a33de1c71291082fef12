MOSCOW, Nov. 6 (Xinhua) -- The China International Import Expo (CIIE) is an "excellent platform" for exhibiting goods and services and establishing business ties with Chinese partners, Russian entrepreneur Klim Komarov has said. "As a result of participation in previous CIIEs, business partners from Russia and China exchanged experience, carried out mutually beneficial deals and determined vectors of strategic cooperation," Komarov, founder of Russian company "Agroexport 168," told Xinhua in a recent interview. The company, one of the largest Russian exporters of frozen meat products to the Asian market, takes part in the CIIE for the first time this year. It also aims to expand the partner portfolio in China and strengthen its position in the key markets. "We hope that participation in the CIIE, taking into account our expanded product line, will increase exports to China by 10 percent," Komarov said, adding that there is great potential for the development of exports of Russian agri-food products to China. Speaking about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on business, Komarov voiced concerns over a temporary lack of opportunities to hold offline meetings with partners, which sometimes becomes an obstacle for promptly resolving issues. Nevertheless, he believes that it is possible for Russian and Chinese companies to achieve the most effective interaction through the expo during the pandemic. "We are actively working on building communication in the existing realities," Komarov said. Enditem
