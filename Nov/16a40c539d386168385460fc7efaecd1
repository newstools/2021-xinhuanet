 Afghanistan on Sunday resumed export of pine nuts to China, a Taliban spokesman confirmed. "A cargo plane carrying pine nuts took off from Kabul International Airport to China after officials of Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan inaugurated the air corridor," spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid wrote on twitter. In 2018, Afghanistan inaugurated the Afghan-China air corridor to facilitate its pine nut exports to China. Pine nut trees grow in eight eastern provinces of Afghanistan, including Khost, Paktia, Paktika, Kapisa, Kunar, Nangarhar, Nuristan and Laghman, according to the country's pine nuts union.
