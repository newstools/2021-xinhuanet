ULAN BATOR, Nov. 17 (Xinhua) -- The Mongolian government has decided to allow all organizations except government agencies to celebrate the upcoming New Year, the country's Health Minister Sereejav Enkhbold said on Wednesday. "The government has allowed only private organizations across the country to hold New Year parties. However, those to attend New Year's events must receive a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccines," Enkhbold told a press conference after the government's regular meeting. New Year is one of the most celebrated holidays in Mongolia. Almost all public and private organizations in the country hold parties with feast at restaurants, night clubs or bars in December to welcome the New Year. The country banned the New Year celebrations in 2020 due to the pandemic. So far, around 66 percent of Mongolia's total population of 3.4 million has received two shots of COVID-19 vaccines, with over 523,300 Mongolians aged over 18 having received a booster shot. The health ministry said at least half of the population is supposed to receive a booster. Enditem
