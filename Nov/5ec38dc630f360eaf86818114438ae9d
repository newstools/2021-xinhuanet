DAMASCUS, Nov. 10 (Xinhua) -- Unknown warplanes struck weapon depots of Iranian-backed militias in Syria's eastern province of Deir al-Zour after midnight, a war monitor reported on Wednesday. Several explosions were heard in the Bukamal area near the Syrian-Iraqi border following the strikes, which led to destroying weapon depots amid confirmed reports on casualties, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The Britain-based watchdog group said the attack is part of repeated targeting of Iranian positions in Deir al-Zour, and the Iranian-backed militias have recently been redeploying in areas they control to avoid aerial targeting. The Iranian-backed militias have helped in defeating Islamic State (IS) militants in parts of Deir al-Zour near the Iraqi border. However, they have been repeatedly targeted by the United States and Israel. Enditem
