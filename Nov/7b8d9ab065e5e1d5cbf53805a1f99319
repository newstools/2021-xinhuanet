ADDIS ABABA, Nov. 26 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian government on Thursday urged the U.S. government and organizations to cease spreading false information regarding the country's current situation. The Ethiopian government has warned the U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa and organizations against their continued practice of spreading false information, state-television Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation quoted State Minister of Ethiopian Government Communication Service Kebede Desisa as saying. This came a day after the U.S. Embassy in Ethiopia issued caution to its citizens residing in Ethiopia over possible terror attacks in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. Earlier, the U.S. government repeatedly warned its citizens to leave the East African country over the expanding conflict in the country. The conflict, which erupted in November last year in Ethiopia's northernmost Tigray region between the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) and the Ethiopian National Defense Forces, has over the past months spread across neighboring Amhara and Afar regions as forces loyal to the TPLF have advanced southward. This prompted huge popular mobilization in the regions as well as other states in the country to fight back the TPLF's expansion. Earlier this month, the Ethiopian House of People's Representatives ratified a six-month state of emergency rule to contain the TPLF's advancement and ensure the country's peace and security. Enditem
