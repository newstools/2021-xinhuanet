QUITO, Nov. 10 (Xinhua) -- Leonardo Gonzalez said Wednesday that he will leave his post as Venezuela's interim manager after the team's 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Ecuador and Peru. The former Venezuela international defender was appointed caretaker boss in August after the resignation of Portuguese coach Jose Peseiro. "We told [the FVF] that we will continue for these next two games and no more," Gonzales told reporters. Venezuela will meet Ecuador in Quito on Thursday and Peru in Caracas next Tuesday. The Vinotinto are currently last in the 10-team South American qualifying group with seven points from 12 matches. "I'm grateful and happy for having had this opportunity," Gonzalez said. "It is a position that I've tried to assume with the greatest responsibility, thinking in what is best for the national team." The 49-year-old, who was capped 37 times for Venezuela from 1993 to 2008, has so far led the Vinotinto to one victory and five defeats. Enditem
