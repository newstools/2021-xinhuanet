KAMPALA, Nov. 17 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday condemned the suicide attacks in the Ugandan capital here that killed six people, including three suicide bombers. "I strongly condemn today's despicable terrorist attacks in Uganda. I offer my condolences to the families of the victims and wish a full recovery to those injured," Guterres tweeted. "All people involved in the commission of these attacks must be swiftly brought to justice," he added. The twin blasts on Tuesday morning at a check point of a police station and on a street with government offices also injured 33 people, according to Ugandan police. A fourth attacker, who had led the three suicide bombers to his house where he was hiding a suicide vest, was arrested. Uganda has blamed the attacks on the Allied Democratic Forces, an affiliate of the Islamic State in Central Africa. Enditem
