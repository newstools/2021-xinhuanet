 In Qian'an, north China's Hebei Province, there lies a 45.3-kilometer-long Great Wall dating back to the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). A total of 23 local villagers are full-time protectors of the wall, including 43-year-old Wu Hailong. He has been patrolling a section of the Great Wall that was built 500 years ago by his family ancestors.  Produced by Xinhua Global Service
