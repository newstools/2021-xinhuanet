OUAGADOUGOU, Nov. 27 (Xinhua) -- Police in Burkina Faso fired tear gas to disperse demonstrators in the West African nation's capital Ouagadougou on Saturday, state-owned news agency AIB reported. It said that tension remains high between demonstrators and the police as the demonstrators burned tires on the streets. They also erected barricades to prevent traffic. During the demonstration, one person was injured and evacuated by the fire brigade, it reported. The nation's major news website, Burkina 24 also reported that several organizers had made an appointment for large-scale demonstrations in order to denounce the management of public affairs. At the Square of Nation in Ouagadougou, the place planned for the gathering, security forces have secured the main entrances, it reported. The demonstrations came amid growing insecurity and mounting anger from the public over a jihadist insurgency in the country. An attack on Nov. 14 left 53 people dead, including 49 police in Inata, Soum Province, in the north of the country. Groups linked to Al-Qaeda and the so-called Islamic State group have plagued the landlocked Sahel nation since 2015. Their attacks reportedly killed thousands of people and displaced 1.4 million from their homes. In a note sent to the security forces on Wednesday, the mayor of Ouagadougou, Armand Beouinde, announced a ban on "illegal demonstrations". The Burkinabe government also announced on Wednesday evening the extension of the suspension of mobile internet for a period of 96 hours from Wednesday throughout the national territory. Enditem
