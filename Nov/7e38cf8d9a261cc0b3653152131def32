TASHKENT, Nov. 25 (Xinhua) -- Uzbekistan plans to raise its fruit and vegetable exports from the current 1.3 billion U.S. dollars to 5 billion dollars by introducing an agricultural cluster system, the Uzbek president's press service said Thursday. Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev told a government meeting that the country will introduce a new system for the development of fruit and vegetable clusters and farms, especially family-based farms, as well as for the expansion of agricultural services. The measures will include allotting preferential loans of 186 million dollars for producers of fruits and vegetables, and creating and financially supporting clusters, so that they can buy finished products from farms and peasants. Also, the Uzbek government will reimburse half of the crop insurance costs for exporters, as well as 50 percent of costs of hired foreign experts, according to the press service. Next year, Uzbekistan will lease 80,000 hectares of land to the population for farming for 10 years. According to the Uzbek State Statistics Committee, Uzbekistan has exported over 1.4 million tons of fruits and vegetables in 2020 to dozens of countries, including China, Russia, Kazakhstan and Pakistan.
