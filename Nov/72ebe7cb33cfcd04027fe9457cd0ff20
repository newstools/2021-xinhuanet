KANDAHAR, Afghanistan, Nov. 8 (Xinhua) -- A total of 500 new policemen who have graduated from a police training center have been deployed in Kandahar to ensure security in the southern Afghan province, head of the training center Mawlawi Madani said Monday. During the two-month training, the recruits have learned how to use variety of rifles, driving skills and how to behave with the people, the official said at the graduation ceremony. He also noted that the new administration would train more youth to serve the nation and ensure peace and security in the conflict-torn country. With the Taliban's formation of a caretaker government of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, all the 350,000-strong security and defense forces of the former administration have been dismantled. The new government has promised to form new security forces by hiring some professional personnel from the former administration. Enditem
