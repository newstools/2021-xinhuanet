ISTANBUL, Nov. 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish police detained 17 suspects in Turkey's biggest city Istanbul for an attempted attack on a crew member of the U.S. Navy, the Istanbul Governor's Office announced on Wednesday. The office said in a written statement that the suspects tried to put a sack over the crew member's head of a naval ship of the U.S. Navy, which recently anchored on Istanbul. It noted that the incident occurred during a city tour, and "the suspects were detained upon the order of the chief public prosecutor's office." The U.S. amphibious command ship USS Mount Whitney arrived in Istanbul on Monday for a scheduled port visit. According to press reports, the ship is expected to sail toward the Black Sea to join a military drill this week. Enditem
