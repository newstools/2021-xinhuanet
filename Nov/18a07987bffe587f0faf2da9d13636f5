LIMA, Nov. 12 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian President Pedro Castillo on Friday called for "inclusive, prompt and adequate solutions" for vulnerable peoples in his speech at the 28th Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders' Meeting. Castillo, attending the event virtually from Lima, called for measures to alleviate poverty and inequality, with a view to contributing to the economic recovery of families and "dealing with crimes." He also proposed all countries in the Asia-Pacific region produce COVID-19 vaccines, and reaffirmed Peru's offer to take on the presidency of APEC in 2024 with the aim of working on an inclusive economic development agenda. The APEC forum is made up of 21 economies that represent the world's most dynamic economic region with over a third of the world population, nearly 60 percent of global GDP and half of global trade.
