BEIJING, Nov. 13 (Xinhua) -- China's tablet computer shipments expanded 10.6 percent, year on year, to around 7.65 million units in the third quarter of 2021, marking a new quarterly high in nearly seven years, said an industry report. The country was the only one globally that saw double-digit growth in tablet shipments for the third quarter, the global market research firm International Data Corporation (IDC) said. IDC has attributed the increase to steady consumer demands and the increasing number of market participants in the industry. "China's shipments of tablets have seen steady growth, which has helped the country to become the second-largest tablet market worldwide," said the IDC, predicting that the market will continue its booming trend in the future. IDC's data also revealed that global tablet manufacturers shipped 42.41 million devices during the period, down 9.3 percent year on year. Enditem
