(Xinhua/Zhao Ge) YULI, Nov. 3 (Xinhua) -- Erkin Rehimc is a cotton farmer from Yuli, a county in the southern part of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China's largest cotton-growing area. Xinjiang has encouraged cotton farmers to apply modern agricultural machinery to boost the development of the industry in recent years. Once a shepherd and a restaurant owner, Erkin Rehimc began growing cotton in 2004 and has benefited from agricultural mechanization since 2017. This year, the 49-year-old cotton farmer uses cotton pickers to harvest his 550 mu (about 90.6 acres) of cotton fields in 24 hours. "We can expect a bumper harvest this year," he said.
