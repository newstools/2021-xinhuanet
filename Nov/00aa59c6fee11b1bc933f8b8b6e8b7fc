ISTANBUL, Nov. 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's fabric and design competition, recently held in the southeastern Gaziantep province for the first time, aims to strengthen the country's textile industry with innovative young creators, sector insiders told Xinhua on Monday. The event, dubbed "Doku", or Fabric in English, gathered over 200 young fabric designers of women's clothing and Turkey's well-known textile engineers and industry representatives. "The competition aims to contribute to the emergence of original, value-added, and innovative fabric designs, train new designers, and strengthen the textile industry," said Fikret Kileci, head of the Southeastern Anatolian Textile and Raw Materials Exporters' Association. "We want to open up to the world with our final outputs by creating environmentally-friendly textile products," Kileci said, referring to the fabrics of the Southeastern Anatolia Region. The contestants showcased their designs at a fashion show in the Zeugma Museum under the consultancy of Dilek Hanif, a Turkish fashion pioneer known for integrating her Anatolian cultural heritage into the world fashion scene. Mihriban Yazir, a graduate student of Istanbul's Marmara University Textile Department, won the first prize with a series of women outfits design called the Scream. "During the COVID-19 period, nature entered a process of renewing itself, with people shutting down in their homes," said Yazir, depicting flowers emerging out of the concrete piles on the sidewalks. Yazir used some tick threads, such as polyester and fishing lines, to give a hard look that resembled stones while using natural yarns such as cotton to show the existence of nature. Riza Tuna Turagay, deputy minister of trade, was quoted as saying by a press release of the event that Turkey's textile and clothing industry achieved 25.5 billion U.S. dollars exports during the first 10 months of this year.
