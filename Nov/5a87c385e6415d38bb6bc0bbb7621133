ADEN, Yemen, Nov. 14 (Xinhua) -- Three people suspected of being members of the Yemen-based al-Qaida branch were killed by an airstrike in Yemen on Sunday, a military official told Xinhua. "Missiles fired by a U.S. drone struck a traveling vehicle passing on road between the provinces of al-Bayda and Shabwa in the country's southern part," the local military source said on condition of anonymity. The airstrike resulted in killing three people suspected of belonging to the Yemen-based al-Qaida branch and injuring two others including a woman at the scene, he said. He confirmed that mountainous areas in Shabwa and other turbulent neighboring provinces are witnessing active presence of al-Qaida members recently. The Yemen-based al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) network, which mostly operates in eastern and southern provinces, has been responsible for many high-profile attacks against security forces in the country. The AQAP has exploited years of deadly conflict between the Yemeni government and Houthi rebels to expand its presence in the war-ravaged Arab country. Enditem
