 This 560-meter-long cliff road is located in north China's Taihang Mountains. It once served as the only way out of mountains for people in Xiagou Village, north China's Hebei Province. Tucked away in the steep Taihang Mountains, local villagers had long suffered from poor transport infrastructure due to the rugged mountainous terrain. The construction of the cliff road was in the 1970s, and was built purely by Xiagou villagers. After decades of development, local infrastructure has been improved and the cliff road has become a tourist scenic spot, attracting visitors to recall the old memories of harsh times in the past and admire people's perseverant fight against nature.
