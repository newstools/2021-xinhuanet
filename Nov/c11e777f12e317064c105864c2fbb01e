DENVER, the United States, Nov. 27 (Xinhua) -- Denver, capital city of Colorado, would set a record for the latest winter snow this year, local media forecasted Saturday, after the city's snowless streak continued through Thanksgiving despite a storm that peppered the nearby Rocky Mountains. Typically, Denver measures its first snow of the new season around Oct. 18, local CBS Denver said, adding that as drought continues to expand around Colorado, there is still no significant snow in sight after the last snowfall of 2021 occurred on April 22. "It looks like we will round out November and enter December with more of the same weather. The next good chance for snow is at least a week away," CBS Denver noted. Last year, an inch of snow fell in Denver on Sept. 8, one of the earliest accumulating snowfalls in the city's history. By the end of the season, more than 80 inches of snow had fallen, the highest total in 37 years. As of Saturday, Denver has gone more than 220 days since measurable snow last fell in the city, the fifth-longest snow-free streak on record. If the long-term forecast comes to fruition, then Denver could set a new record for the most consecutive days with no accumulating snow. The cause of the snowlessness in Denver is La Nina. Colorado state climatologist Russ Schumacher was quoted by the USA Today as saying that a La Nina climate pattern has set up with results consistent with its influence. That includes heavy rain in the Pacific Northwest resulting in devastating flooding, and southern states that have seen continual dry conditions. Enditem
