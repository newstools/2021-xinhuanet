Speaking to reporters at a press conference held in Islamabad, Umar, who is also Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives, said: "Previous experiences show that it can spread across the world, including Pakistan, because the world is so interconnected that it is impossible to stop any new variant from spreading." Currently, people getting fully vaccinated is a logical solution against threat of the Omicron variant, according to the minister. The minister announced that the Pakistani government will launch a big vaccination campaign nationwide this week, adding that the number of daily tests will also increase with more resources put in. The minister said that currently 50 million Pakistani people are fully vaccinated.
