Located in the city of Guiping, the project is one of the important engineering projects listed in China's 13th Five-Year Plan. It is designed for multiple purposes including flood control, navigation and power generation. It will also reduce river salinity during the dry season, thus ensuring the quality of water supplied to cities in the Pearl River Delta including Macao. (Xinhua/Cao Yiming)
