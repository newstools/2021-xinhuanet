HONG KONG, Nov. 18 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government on Thursday strongly condemned and opposed the various unfounded allegations made by a report of the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC). It said that in the 2021 USCC report, the commission made unfounded allegations on Hong Kong affairs ranging from the national security law in Hong Kong to the financial hub's business environment. "The HKSAR government once again urges the United States to respect the international law and basic norms governing international relations. Any attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of China through Hong Kong will not succeed and we will continue to discharge our responsibility of safeguarding national security resolutely," said a spokesperson for the HKSAR government in a press release.
