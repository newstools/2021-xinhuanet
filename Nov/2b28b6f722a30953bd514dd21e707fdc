 During the construction of the Karot Hydropower Project, a major pilot project under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the China Three Gorges Corporation (CTG) has tried to minimize the social and environmental impact of the project. With an investment of about 1.74 billion U.S. dollars, the Karot Hydropower Project in Pakistan's eastern Punjab province is the fourth level of the five cascade hydropower stations planned for the Jhelum River. The project has provided over 4,000 jobs for the locals during the peak time of its construction. The forthcoming commercial operation of the hydropower station project will further address the electricity shortage in Pakistan with cheap and clean energy and improve the energy structure of the country. The 720-megawatt Karot Hydropower Project is expected to annually generate some 3.2 billion kilowatt-hours of clean electricity once put into operation, reducing 3.5 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year.
