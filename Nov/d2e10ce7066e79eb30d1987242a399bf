UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 22 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese envoy on Monday called for comprehensive measures to combat the trafficking of small arms and light weapons. The control of small arms and light weapons has a bearing on peace and security. Combating their trafficking is of great importance to safeguarding the economic development and social progress of all countries. It is, therefore, a matter of urgency to strengthen conventional arms control within a multilateral framework, said Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the United Nations. Over the years, the UN Security Council has made unremitting efforts to tackle the issue. It adopted Resolutions 2117 and 2220 and has taken into overall consideration the impact of small arms and light weapons when deliberating on regional hot-spot issues, he told a Security Council open debate on small arms. However, the trafficking of small arms and light weapons remains a serious problem, which is intertwined with armed conflict, terrorism, transnational organized crime, and other threats, aggravating the suffering of people in conflict areas and posing a great challenge to international peace and security, said Zhang. He asked the international community to focus on four areas: strengthen the capacity-building of the countries concerned and achieve the full-cycle management of small arms and light weapons, help regional countries achieve post-COVID recovery and address the root causes of conflict and violence, strictly implement Security Council arms embargoes and cut off the chain of the illegal flow of small arms and light weapons, and strengthen multilateral and bilateral pragmatic cooperation and fully leverage the role of the United Nations as the main channel.
