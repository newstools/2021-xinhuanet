TEHRAN, Nov. 19 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry Spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh on Friday refuted the U.S. allegations of interfering in the 2020 U.S. presidential elections, condemning the new U.S. sanctions against six Iranian nationals and an Iranian company under that "false pretext." "The Islamic Republic of Iran condemns the new U.S. sanctions in the continuation of the failed policy of (former U.S. President Donald) Trump's maximum pressure, which are desperate and illegitimate actions," Khatibzadeh was quoted as saying by a report on Iran's Foreign Ministry's website. Saying these allegations are groundless, he added that the U.S. government is with a long history of interfering in different countries' affairs in various forms to deceive public opinion. On Thursday, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against six Iranian nationals and an Iranian cyber-company for what it called "attempting to influence" the 2020 U.S. presidential elections.
