TOKYO, Nov. 15 (Xinhua) -- The latest data on credit card use for October showed that spending in Japan rose above pre-pandemic levels for the first time in 11 months after a COVID-19 state of emergency was fully lifted on Oct. 1 across Japan, local media reported Monday. The consumption index, which was compiled by credit card company JCB and data analysis firm Nowcast, increased 4.1 percent compared to the October average for the three years through 2018. Due to the rising crude oil prices, spending at the gas pump jumped 7.7 percent from the previous month, logging the first positive figure in 20 months. In addition, expenditures on accommodation, leisure, travel, and dining out also showed improvements in reporting month. Looking ahead, researchers expect consumption to keep recovering at a steady pace but warn that a possible resurgence in COVID-19 may hurt the consumption again. Enditem
