CHICAGO, Nov. 12 (Xinhua) -- Chicago police announced Friday that an 18-year-old man has been charged with first-degree murder in Tuesday's death of a 24-year-old Chinese student who just graduated from the University of Chicago (UChicago). The man, Alton Spann, has also been charged with armed robbery and two counts of unlawful use of a weapon. Police used campus cameras, private cameras, and other cameras to track the car the suspect used to flee, local media reported. After allegedly shooting the UChicago Chinese graduate, Spann took his possessions, including electronics. Police also have video of Spann selling the victim's property at a cell phone store. One of the firearms Spann had possessed when he was arrested was confirmed as the one he used in the fatal shooting, police said. The victim was on a sidewalk at around 1:54 p.m. (1954 GMT) Tuesday when a man took out a gun, demanded property, and shot him in the chest, before he was taken to the UChicago Hospital where he was pronounced dead.
