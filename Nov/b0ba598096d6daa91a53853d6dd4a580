BEIJING, Nov. 15 (Xinhua) -- China's surveyed urban unemployment rate stood at 4.9 percent in October, 0.4 percentage points lower than the same period last year, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed Monday. During the first 10 months of this year, the country created 11.33 million new jobs in its urban areas, achieving the target for the whole year in advance. The surveyed unemployment rate among those aged between 25 and 59, the majority of the labor market, stood at 4.2 percent in October, the same level as in September. The surveyed unemployment rate in 31 major cities was 5.1 percent last month, up 0.1 percentage points from that in September. The surveyed urban unemployment rate is calculated based on the number of unemployed people who have participated in the employment survey in urban areas, including migrant workers in cities. Enditem
