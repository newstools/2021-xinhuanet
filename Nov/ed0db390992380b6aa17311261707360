KIEV, Nov. 15 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries have not reached a consensus on inviting Ukraine to the military alliance, Ukraine's state-run Ukrinform news agency reported Monday, citing NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. "We have no consensus agreement in NATO now on inviting Ukraine into becoming a full member," Stoltenberg said in an interview with the U.S. television channel HBO, adding that NATO has strengthened relations with Ukraine. In a political statement at the Bucharest Summit in 2008, NATO said Ukraine will eventually become a member of the bloc, but refused to provide the Membership Action Plan to Kiev, the first step in the legal procedure for joining the organization. After the pro-West authorities came into power in Ukraine in 2014, the country has increased interactions with NATO and made joining the bloc a priority. NATO recognized Ukraine as its Enhanced Opportunities Partner in 2020. However, the organization has not promised Ukraine immediate membership prospects. Enditem
