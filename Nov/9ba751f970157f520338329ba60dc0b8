 Concrete casting for the foundation of one of the piers of Longmen Bridge was completed on Sunday. 47,000 cubic meters of concrete was poured into the circular concrete raft in less than 5 days. The efficiency is believed to have set a new record in bridge building of its kind. The 7.6 km-long bridge will be the longest sea crossing bridge in Guangxi upon completion. It's part of a major expressway connecting coastal cities of Guangxi.  Produced by Xinhua Global Service
