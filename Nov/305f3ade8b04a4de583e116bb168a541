DAR ES SALAAM, Nov. 5 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's exports to African countries increased to 2.27 billion U.S. dollars in 2020 from 2.03 billion U.S. dollars in 2019, an increase of 11.8 percent, said the East African Business Council (EABC) on Friday. John Bosco Kalisa, the EABC chief executive officer, revealed Tanzania's exports trend to African countries at the launch of the African Due Diligence Platform in the commercial capital Dar es Salaam. The Due Diligence Platform is among innovative solutions put in place to transform Africa's trade and helped to solve challenges African countries are facing in trading with each other. Kalisa urged the East African Community (EAC) to align trade policy, eliminate non-tariff barriers, ease access to trade finance for small and medium enterprises, enhance productive capacity and factor market integration to tap into the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) market. Paul Makanza, the chairman of the Confederation of Tanzania Industries (CTI), said intra-Africa trade is still low at approximately 16.6 percent of total Africa exports to the globe. Makanza said January 1, 2021, signaled a new dawn for Africa as trading under AfCFTA commenced. He commended the EAC heads of state for ratifying the AfCFTA and called upon the Tanzania private sector to seize the moment and opportunities availed by the continental market. Enditem
