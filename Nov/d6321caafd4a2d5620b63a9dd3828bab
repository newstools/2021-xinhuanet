LUSAKA, Nov. 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is set to officially launch flights for its national airline on December 1, 2021, its Board of Directors said on Monday. In 2018, the Zambian government signed a shareholding agreement with Ethiopian Airlines to restart operations of Zambia Airways which stopped operations in 1994. But the commencement of operations has dragged on over the years and the launch of flights which was initially scheduled for September 30th, 2021, was postponed. But according to a release, said the airline will officially commence operations on December 1. The release noted that the airline will initially operate domestic routes on a frequency of five to six times from Lusaka, the country's capital, to the city of Ndola on the Copperbelt Province and the southern city of Livingstone. The airline will later introduce domestic routes to Mfuwe district in the eastern part of the country and Solwezi in the northwestern part of the country before adding regional destinations in South Africa and Zimbabwe in the first quarter of 2022, it added. According to the official, the airline was committed to enhancing tourism and investments in the country as well as to ensuring job creation and has called for support. "The airline will strictly adhere to COVID-19 guidelines to guarantee a safe environment on all our flights," the release said. Enditem
