KINSHASA, Nov. 17 (Xinhua) -- The head of the Goma Volcanology Observatory (OVG), Kasereka Mahinda, warned Wednesday of an imminent internal eruption of the Nyamulagira volcano, the most active in Africa, located in the northeast of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). In a statement, Kasereka Mahinda said he found Tuesday that "magma is not very far away and that it can come out inside as well as outside the crater (of the volcano)". However, He still called on the entire population of the region to remain calm, reassuring that this volcanic activity does not yet represent any risk, as it is still concentrated in the crater. The last external eruption of the Nyamulagira volcano dated back to 2011. Since 2014, multiple internal eruptions have been reported inside the Nyamulagira volcano, said Kasereka Mahinda. "If this eruption turns out to be external, it could lead to human and environmental consequences, including the destruction of the ecosystem and many others," he warned. The Nyamulagira volcano, located in the North Kivu province, is very active, whose lava could flow into the nearby Virunga National Park and surrounding cities. Goma, the capital of the North Kivu province, is home to two active volcanoes, Nyamulagira and Nyiragongo. The Nyiragongo volcano erupted on May 22, killing at least 32 people. Enditem
