BEIJING, Nov. 7 (Xinhua) -- China's logistics activity posted a slower expansion in October as the resurgence of COVID-19 affected the production capacity of enterprises, data from the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing (CFLP) showed. The logistics performance index, which tracks business volumes, new orders, employment, inventory turnovers and equipment utility rates in the sector, came in at 53.5 percent last month, down 0.5 percentage points from September. A reading above 50 percent indicates expansion while a reading below 50 reflects contraction. Despite a decrease from a month earlier, the index remained in the expansion zone, indicating a stable logistic demand in the consumption side, the CFLP noted. The sub-index for new orders came in at 52.7 percent, down 0.6 percentage points from September. The sub-index for business activity expectations came in at 62 percent, reflecting that the logistics sector will maintain a steady and moderate growth trend. Enditem
