MOSCOW, Nov. 1 (Xinhua) -- Russia will adequately react to any foreign attempts to "break strategic parity," President Vladimir Putin said on Monday. "Some of our foreign colleagues are not abandoning attempts to break this parity, including through the deployment of global missile defense system components in the immediate vicinity of our borders," Putin said at a meeting with senior defense officials in Russia's Sochi. "We cannot fail to notice these threats to Russia's security and will respond appropriately and adequately," he stressed. Putin said that in light of U.S. plans to deploy medium-range missiles in Europe, which poses a threat to Russia, the country is working to increase the share of modern equipment and weaponry in the air and missile defense forces to 80 percent in 2025-2027. Putin will host a series of biannual meetings this week with military representatives on the development of Russia's armed forces. Enditem
