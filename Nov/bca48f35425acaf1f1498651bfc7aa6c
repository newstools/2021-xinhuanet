LUSAKA, Nov. 19 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Vice-President Mutale Nalumango on Friday said the government has not relaxed in its fight against corruption and that the fight was still on. The Zambian vice-president said the fight was ongoing and that all those who will be found wanting will be prosecuted. Responding to questions in parliament from lawmakers who wanted to find out if the fight against corruption was still on and why there seem to be no progress so far, the vice-president said the government has not forgotten the alleged corruption of the previous leaders, adding that all cases will be followed up. According to her, the government has embarked on a mechanical way of tackling corruption and that investigative wings wanted to conduct thorough investigations before any action could be taken. "It is important that we do things correctly and investigative wings must be concerned with the concerns being raised by people to quickly deal with the cases. The zero-tolerance on corruption is still on," she said. Enditem
