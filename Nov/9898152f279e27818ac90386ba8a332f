LAGOS, Nov. 16 (Xinhua) -- A gas explosion on Tuesday morning rocks a market in Lagos, Nigeria's economic hub, killing at least five people and injuring some others, an official said. Ibrahim Farinloye, coordinator of the National Emergency Management Agency(NEMA) in the Lagos state, told Xinhua on the phone a gas explosion happened at about 8:00 a.m. local time on Tuesday at a liquefied petroleum gas retailing center in a popular market in Lagos, resulting in casualties. "Four adults, comprising three males and one female, were recovered dead," Farinloye said, adding a 10-year-old boy who was rescued alive died on his way to the hospital. He said responders have put the fire out as rescue and recovery of bodies were ongoing. Balogun Mubaraq, a resident in the area, told Xinhua many people with various degrees of burns have been rushed to a local hospital. Enditem
