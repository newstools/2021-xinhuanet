PHNOM PENH, Nov. 2 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia on Tuesday resumed the operations of city bus and taxi boat services in capital Phnom Penh after a long hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, said Ean Sokhim, director of the Phnom Penh City Bus Authority. "All passengers are given free rides for six days from Nov. 2 to Nov. 7, 2021, and normal fares will be charged from Nov. 8, 2021 onwards, except for Buddhist monks, elderly people, small children, students, garment workers, athletes and teachers," he said in a statement. All passengers must wear a facemask, have their body temperatures checked and hands sanitized, and scan "Stop COVID QR Code" with their smartphones, Sokhim said, adding that for adult passengers, they must show their COVID-19 vaccination cards at the entrance. Cambodia has seen a dramatic drop in new COVID-19 cases and fatalities as 13.74 million people, or 85.92 percent of the country's 16 million population, have so far received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccines, 13.08 million, or 81.7 percent, have been fully inoculated with both required shots, and 1.88 million, or 11.7 percent, have taken a booster dose, the Ministry of Health said. Most of the COVID-19 vaccines used in the kingdom's immunization program are China's Sinovac and Sinopharm brands. The Southeast Asian nation reported 89 new COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, raising the national total caseload to 118,702, the Ministry of Health said, adding that six new fatalities were recorded, taking the overall death toll to 2,800.
