NEW DELHI, Nov. 4 (Xinhua) -- Ten people were killed and many others taken ill after consuming toxic liquor in the eastern Indian state of Bihar, local media reported Thursday. The casualties were reported from West Champaran and Gopalganj districts, north of Patna, the capital city of Bihar. "Prima facie, these deaths seem to have occurred following the consumption of poisonous substances. However, the exact cause of the death could only be known after the post mortem report," a local newspaper Hindustan Times quoted a senior police officer as having said. According to the newspaper, a dozen people were rushed to hospitals after they complained of nausea, headache, vomiting and vision problems. Locals told the media the victims had purchased the liquor from local vendors. Spurious alcohol deaths are often reported in India, where people often drink cheap country-made bootleg liquor. Enditem
