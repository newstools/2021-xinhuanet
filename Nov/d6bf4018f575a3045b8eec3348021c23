PARIS, Nov. 30 (Xinhua) -- France's gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 3 percent in the third quarter (Q3) of 2021, the country's National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) said on Tuesday. Total domestic demand (excluding stock) contributed positively to its evolution, especially the sharply accelerated household final consumption expenditure, the INSEE explained in a report. Meanwhile, France's exports increased by 2.5 percent while its imports were stable during the third quarter of this year. As for the general government deficit, the INSEE said that it stood at 5.6 percent of France's GDP. "This improvement was due to a rise in public revenues linked with the increase in economic activity," the INSEE added. Enditem
