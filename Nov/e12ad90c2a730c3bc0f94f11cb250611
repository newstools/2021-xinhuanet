TAIPEI, Nov. 24 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan approved 32 investment projects from the Chinese mainland from January to October this year, a year-on-year decrease of 61.45 percent, while approved investment volume dropped 66.68 percent year on year to 41.3 million U.S. dollars, the island's economic affairs department has said.
