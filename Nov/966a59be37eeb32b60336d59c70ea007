GUIYANG, Nov. 3, 2021 (Xinhua) -- Unlike many other embroidery styles, the horse tail embroidery of the Shui people in southwest China is characterized by unique prefabricated sewing threads made up of horse tail fibers wound with silk yarns from the outside. Horse tail embroidery is an acclaimed traditional art that is also recognized as a national intangible cultural heritage due to its sophisticated procedures. Many women of the Shui ethnic group in Sandu Shui Autonomous County, southwest China's Guizhou Province, received training as embroiderers of the traditional craft as a means to increase their income.
