 Li Jian works at a bird banding station in the Wuliang Mountain Nature Reserve in southwest China's Yunnan Province. Every autumn, Li and his colleagues are busy with bird banding, a technique used for identifying and studying individual birds. The researchers can trace the migrating routes and flock development of the birds by fixing specially-devised metal bands onto their legs. Li works at the station some 300 days a year and he feels proud of his work since he can help improve the biodiversity of Wuliang Mountain.
