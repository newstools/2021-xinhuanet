 African officials and experts expressed hope for closer ties with China, as the Eighth Ministerial Conference of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) is to be held in Dakar, Senegal later this month. At the initiative of both China and African countries, FOCAC was inaugurated at its first Ministerial Conference in Beijing in October 2000, with the goals of responding to the challenges emerging from economic globalization, and seeking common development. Over the past two decades, FOCAC has become an important platform for collective dialogue between China and Africa and an effective mechanism for pragmatic cooperation. FOCAC now has 55 members comprising China, the 53 African countries that have diplomatic relations with China, and the African Union Commission. To date three summits and seven ministerial conferences have been convened, releasing a series of important documents to guide cooperation, and promoting the implementation of a series of major measures to facilitate development in Africa and solidify China-Africa friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation. At the end of November 2021, FOCAC will meet in African co-chair country Senegal. The meeting will evaluate the implementation of the outcomes of the 2018 Beijing Summit, and make plans for friendly cooperation in the next phase.  Produced by Xinhua Global Service
