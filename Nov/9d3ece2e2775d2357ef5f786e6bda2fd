 Two Chinese astronauts completed their extravehicular activities (EVAs) during the construction of China's space station on Monday.  It marks the first EVAs in Chinese space history involving a female taikonaut, Wang Yaping.  Behind the success were the efforts of the coaching team that includes Wu Hao, the only female coach.  China launched the Shenzhou-13 spaceship on Oct. 16, sending three taikonauts on a six-month mission to construct its space station.  Produced by Xinhua Global Service
