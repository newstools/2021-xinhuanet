An eyewitness claimed that three worshippers were killed and 15 others injured in the blast inside a mosque in Spin Ghar district. Locals believed that the number of casualties could be higher as the mosque was crowded during the Friday prayer and no group has claimed responsibility so far.

The Islamic State terror group had claimed responsibility for the previous blast that left over a dozen dead and injured.  Produced by Xinhua Global Service
