HAVANA, Nov. 4 (Xinhua) -- Cuba expects a gradual economic recovery with projected foreign investment flows of some 2 billion U.S. dollars in 2022, Cuban Minister of Foreign Trade and Investment Rodrigo Malmierca said Thursday. In the hope of attracting overseas investors, the Caribbean nation has prioritized strategic economic sectors, "such as renewable energy, tourism and national food production," Malmierca said on the sidelines of a news conference ahead of the second Cuba Business Forum, which will be held online from Nov. 29 to Dec. 2. The minister stressed the importance of China as one of Cuba's main trade partners, saying that the island welcomes more direct investment from Chinese companies. According to official figures, Cuba's GDP has contracted 13 percent since the COVID-19 pandemic first hit the country in March 2020. Enditem
