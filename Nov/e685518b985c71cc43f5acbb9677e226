SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. San Francisco Mayor London Breed on Thursday celebrated the grand opening of two new affordable housing developments in the city. The new apartments at Broadway Cove are available to households with incomes ranging between 30-120 percent of the Area Median Income, while city-sponsored subsidy programs support 28 of the senior apartments located at 735 Davis, the announcement said. "To address our city's housing crisis, we need to be willing to take on projects like the ones we are celebrating today," said Breed. "As we recover from this pandemic and fully reopen our economy, it is critical for San Franciscans to have the opportunity to live and thrive in the city they call home." In October 2018, Breed announced a 1.5-million-U.S.-dollar investment to ensure 735 Davis would be affordable to very low-income seniors through the Senior Operating Subsidy program. The funding cuts rents in half for 13 senior housing units. Additionally, 15 units are supported by the Local Operating Subsidy Program, part of Breed's Homelessness Recovery Plan. Enditem
