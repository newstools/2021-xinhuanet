TEHRAN, Nov. 3 (Xinhua) -- The naval force of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) have thwarted a U.S. attempt to take over the Iranian oil in the Sea of Oman, state TV reported. "The U.S. (forces) confiscated a tanker carrying Iranian exported oil in the waters of the Sea of Oman and transferred the shipment to another tanker trying to lead it to an unknown destination," said the report without specifying the date of the action. However, the IRGC navy forces, in a heliborne operation, landed on the deck of the tanker, took control and directed it to the Iranian territorial waters, it said. Following the IRGC's operation of capturing the tanker, "the U.S. forces used several helicopters and warships to follow the tanker, but (their action) was thwarted by decisive and authoritative involvement of (supportive) IRGC forces," the report added. Further attempts by the U.S. "warships to block the path of the tanker" were failed, it said, adding that the tanker is currently in the territorial waters of the Islamic republic. Enditem
