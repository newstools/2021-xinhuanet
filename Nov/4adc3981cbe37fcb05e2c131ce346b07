 Aerial photo taken on Nov. 11, 2021 shows a view of the power transmission project by the Yangtze River in Wuhu, east China's Anhui Province. In Wuhu, east China's Anhui Province, a team of utility technicians work like "spider men" along the Yangtze River, riveting screws and building power transmission towers that are over 100 meters tall. The work of the "spider men" is part of the "Baihetan-Jiangsu" ultra-high-voltage (UHV) power transmission project. The 800-kilovolt, direct-current transmission project, covering a total length of 2,087 kilometers, is celebrated as one of China's "power highways" and is an important part of the country's west-to-east power transmission program. When completed, the project will transmit 31.2 billion kWh of electricity per year.
