SANTIAGO, Nov. 22 (Xinhua) -- Chile has applied more than 40 million vaccine doses against COVID-19, Health Minister Enrique Paris said Monday. "As of yesterday (Sunday), the 'I get vaccinated' vaccination campaign has succeeded in administering more than 40 million doses of vaccines," Paris said at a press conference. The milestone represented a "great job, an excellent job, undertaken by the Health Ministry in conjunction with primary care, cities and also other ministries," said Paris. Some 13.78 million people over 18 years of age in Chile are now fully vaccinated against the disease, or 90.76 percent of the target population of about 15.2 million people, according to the minister. He noted 4.77 million doses have been applied to children and adolescents between the ages of six and 17, and called on vaccine skeptics to "approach the vaccination centers." Chile on Monday registered 2,252 new cases of COVID-19 and 32 more deaths from the disease in the 24-hour period, raising the total confirmed caseload to 1,745,305 and the pandemic death toll to 38,149 since the onset of the outbreak in the country.
