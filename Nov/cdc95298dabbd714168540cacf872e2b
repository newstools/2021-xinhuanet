WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 (Xinhua) -- Hospitals across the United States are reportedly asking for donations of gently used crutches and canes due to aluminum shortage and supply chain issues. "A global aluminum shortage has left hospitals like Beaufort Memorial without much-needed supplies of crutches for patients, prompting a request for community donations of gently used adult crutches," according to a recent release from Beaufort Memorial Hospital in South Carolina. Hospitals in such states as Texas and Utah are also urging donations of orthopedic equipment. The lack of raw aluminum was reported to have been impacting companies producing everything from canned goods and soft drinks to cars and computers. Facing this together with supply chain issues, hospitals nationwide are struggling to keep certain products on the shelves, Brady Gendke, vice president of operations at Cook Children's Home Health in North Texas, told FOX 13 News.
