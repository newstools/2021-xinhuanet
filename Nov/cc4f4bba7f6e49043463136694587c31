WASHINGTON, Nov. 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. retail sales rose by 1.7 percent in October amid surging inflation, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. Retail sales totaled 638.2 billion U.S. dollars in October, 16.3 percent above October 2020, according to the report. September's retail sales were revised up from an increase of 0.7 percent to 0.8 percent, the report showed. Retail sales previously dropped in May after surging in the prior two months, and then declined in July amid a Delta variant-driven COVID-19 surge. "The 1.7 percent increase in October retail sales bested consensus expectations and sets up holiday sales for another record gain," Tim Quinlan and Shannon Seery, economists at Wells Fargo Securities, wrote in a note. "But the real insight in today's report is how wallet share is shifting as consumers reprioritize spending amid the highest inflation in 30 years," they continued. Spending at restaurants was flat, which is "surprising" given that consumer prices for food away from home rose by the most since 1981 in October, according to Quinlan and Seery, who noted that maybe some diners are moving down the price curve from upscale full-service dining experiences toward "more humble fast-casual options." According to data released by the Labor Department last week, U.S. inflation remained elevated in October as supply chain disruptions persisted, with the consumer price index soaring 6.2 percent over the past 12 months, which marks the fastest pace in three decades in the country. The index surged 0.9 percent in October month on month after rising 0.4 percent in September, with the energy index up 4.8 percent over the month and the food index up 0.9 percent, the report showed.
