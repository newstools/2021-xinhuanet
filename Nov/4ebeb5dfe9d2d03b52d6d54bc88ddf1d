According to Belta news agency, Lukashenko noted that many refugees have mobile phones and people receive information about what is happening from the internet. "There are many different signals on your phones. Half of them are fair and honest. And half are not true. And you need, while being here, learn to distinguish between truth and falsehood," the president said. About 2,000 refugees, mainly from the Middle East, tried to cross the border between Belarus and Poland and enter the European Union in early November. Poland sent troops to the border and prevented refugees from entering its territory. Hundreds of people remain at the border, hoping to enter the European Union and seek asylum.
