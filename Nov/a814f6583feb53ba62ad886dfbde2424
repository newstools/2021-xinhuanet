BEIJING, Nov. 26 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese mainland official for Taiwan affairs stressed on Friday that the reunification of the motherland is the general trend of history and a just cause supported by all Chinese people. Liu Jieyi, who is head of both the Taiwan Work Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, made the remarks at the eighth cross-Strait think tank academic forum. Liu said continued efforts will be made to deepen cross-Strait integrated development and forge closer bonds between compatriots across the Taiwan Strait. He pointed out that the separatist forces seeking "Taiwan independence" pose an obstacle to national rejuvenation and therefore must be eliminated. Liu said that China will be compelled to take resolute measures, should the separatist forces "provoke us, force our hands or even cross the red line." Representatives from institutions including the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots and the Taiwan-based think tank 21st Century Foundation also delivered speeches. Themed on commemorating the Revolution of 1911, the forum was attended via video link by over 90 experts, scholars and Taiwan businesspeople and youths. Enditem
