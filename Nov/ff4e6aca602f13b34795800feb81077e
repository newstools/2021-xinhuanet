 "This is the best laboratory of crop molecular biology in east Africa. I often use this lab," said Mohamed Chungwa, a Kenyan horticulture postgraduate. The Kenya-China Joint Laboratory for Crop Molecular Biology, based in Egerton University's Confucius Institute, was jointly built in 2016 by China's Nanjing Agricultural University and Kenya's Egerton University. In 2019, the lab became the first batch of the Belt and Road Joint Laboratory approved by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China.  Produced by Xinhua Global Service■
