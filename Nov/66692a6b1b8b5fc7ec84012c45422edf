LUSAKA, Nov. 2 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese firm, China Electronics Technology Taiji Group Company Limited (CETC), on Tuesday donated 10 computers to Zambia's biggest public university, the University of Zambia (UNZA). The computers were donated to the Department of Computer Science to support its efforts in imparting Information and Communication Technology (ICT) knowledge. UNZA Vice Chancellor Luke Mumba thanked the Chinese firm for its generous donation which will help the department to actualize its mandate to provide quality education, according to a release. He said the government has a deliberate agenda to embrace digital transformation and an economy that thrives on information technology, adding that to support the effort, the education sector needs to channel out more graduates to drive the digital transformation. He further said the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the university and the Chinese firm in November 2019 on funding and development of the information technology innovation center reaffirmed the commitment of the working partnership between China and Zambia to support the digital transformation agenda. "As an institution, we are grateful for your support and are proud to be associated with you. I hope that we shall continue counting on your support in the future as we engage in many other activities," he said. The computers were handed over by Wang Yao, the company's managing director at the Zambia office, according to the release. Enditem
