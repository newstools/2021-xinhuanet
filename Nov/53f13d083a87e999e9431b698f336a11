NEW DELHI, Nov. 16 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government said on Tuesday that it would reopen the Kartarpur corridor for Sikh pilgrims. The corridor, according to officials, will be reopened from Wednesday. "In a major decision that will benefit large numbers of Sikh pilgrims, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has decided to re-open the Kartarpur Sahib corridor from tomorrow (Nov. 17). This decision reflects the immense reverence of Modi government towards Shri Guru Nanak Dev and our Sikh community," Indian Home Minister Amit Shah wrote on social media. The corridor, which connects the Dera Baba Nanak shrine in Indian Punjab with Gurdwara Darbar Sahib at Kartarpur in Pakistan, provides visa-free access to Indian Sikhs to visit Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan. The 4.4-km corridor has been shut for more than a year. There was a growing demand from the Sikh leaders of Punjab for the reopening of the corridor. Movement on the Kartarpur corridor was suspended in March 2020, when Pakistan put restrictions on travel from India after the COVID-19 outbreak. Reports said Pakistan first expressed its willingness to reopen the corridor on June 27, citing improvement in the pandemic situation. Sikhs are a minority in both India and Pakistan. Enditem
