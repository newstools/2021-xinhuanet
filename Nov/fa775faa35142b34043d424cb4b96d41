CHICAGO, Nov. 12 (Xinhua) -- A 10-day retrospective on films made by Chinese director Xie Fei kicked off online at a pop-up cinema here on Friday. The films represent Xie's best works and feature stories from different ethnic groups in China, Sophia Wong Boccio, founder of Asian Pop-Up Cinema, told Xinhua. The films, "while all fictional, are collectively a historical documentary" of the stories of ordinary Chinese people from the 1960s to 1980s, Boccio added. The online screenings include "Black Snow," winner of Silver Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival in 1990, and "A Mongolian Tale," which netted Xie the Best Director Award at the Montreal World Film Festival in 1995. Xie, born in 1942, is among the "Fourth-Generation" film directors in China. He attended the Beijing Film Academy, where he later became a professor and vice president. Enditem
