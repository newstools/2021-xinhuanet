The band "Zhe'ergen" comes from Guiyang, capital city of southwest China's Guizhou province. Of the four members, lead singer Yang Zhi and flutist Yang Lin are both visually impaired, meaning they require special arrangements when performing. Bass player Peng Wanhai takes charge of almost all of the preparation for rehearsals and performances. During the day, they work doing massage and delivering goods. After a day's hard work, they meet each other and rehearse for around five or six hours a night. The band dreams to produce its own albums and hold concerts, as well as conveying the message that visually impaired people can perform on stage and live a normal life. Despite their visual impairment, music gives them a vivid experience of the world. One of their song lyrics says, "I want my life to shine, light up my dark night, regardless of the pain."
