KHARTOUM, Nov. 7 (Xinhua) -- General Commander of the Sudanese Armed Forces Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan on Sunday reiterated commitment to democratic transition in the country, official Sudan TV reported. Al-Burhan made the remarks when he received a delegation of the Arab League led by Hossam Zaki, assistant secretary-general of the Arab bloc. "The armed forces are committed to the democratic transition until an elected government selected by the people is reached," Al-Burhan was quoted by Sudan TV as saying. Zaki stressed the importance of dialogue among all Sudanese components to reach a satisfactory settlement for all parties. He further expressed the Arab League's readiness to help the Sudanese parties sit at the negotiating table. Sudan has been suffering from a political crisis after Al-Burhan declared a state of emergency on Oct. 25 and dissolved the sovereign council and government. The Forces of Freedom and Change alliance, the civilian component in the ruling coalition, accused Al-Burhan of carrying out a military coup. Enditem
