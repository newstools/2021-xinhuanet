In recent years, Fushan Township has planted 1,200 acres of chrysanthemums using basins and terraces as planting methods, with an annual output worth of more than 30 million yuan, which creates jobs for more than 100 villagers. Villagers not only benefit from employment on their doorstep, but can also receive a dividend from rented land. Annual payment for villagers’ labor expenses exceeds 2 million yuan. The bright chrysanthemum fields have become a hit with tourists, characterizing the integrated development of agriculture and tourism in the area.
