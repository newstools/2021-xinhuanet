In Fuping County, north China’s Hebei Province, a park ranger named Duan Jinlong has patrolled this forest every day for thirty years, working tirelessly to protect it from forest fires. He walks 20 kilometers every day and claims to have broken countless pairs of shoes hiking in the mountains. There have been no accidents in the forest for many years under his protection. He said he is proud to serve as park ranger at Dongfeng Forest Park. (Xinhuanet/Wang Lipeng, Li Bo)
