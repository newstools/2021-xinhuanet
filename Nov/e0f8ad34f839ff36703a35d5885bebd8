 Dozens of foreigners in northeastern Chinese city of Shenyang have staged multilingual livestreams to sell Chinese products via cross-border e-commerce platforms during China's "Double Eleven" shopping festival.  Anastassia, a Russian broadcaster, has been busy livestreaming and replying to rapid-fire comments and questions scrolling across the screen from her Russian customers for a whole day.  "The Russians also know how to scramble for the coupons. They are eagerly looking forward to the carnival every year," Anastassia beamed at her own words.  As the Chinese brands have increased their presence on the global playing field, the cross-border e-commerce platforms in China have helped Daniela Sena's live channel go viral.  The Brazilian livestreamer has become a livestreaming celebrity with 50,000 fans from her country.  Produced by Xinhua Global Service
