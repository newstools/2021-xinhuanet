LISBON, Nov. 26 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese parliament approved on Friday the law authorizing surrogacy, which is the commercial contract that allows the hiring of a woman to be pregnant and give birth to a child who will be delivered to other people. The new diploma received positive opinions from the National Council for Medically Assisted Procreation and the Portuguese Society for Reproductive Medicine, which added an article limiting this right to natural citizens or permanent residents of Portugal. According to the approved law, the pregnant woman for hire must have already been the mother of her own child. It is also decided that the contract should receive prior authorization from the National Council for Medically Assisted Procreation, which is the Portuguese entity that oversees the entire process. The diploma provides that the pregnant woman hired to carry the child can give up and keep the baby until the time of registration of the child, which must take place up to 20 days after birth. This condition is in response to a request from the Portuguese Constitutional Court, which rejected a previous proposal that limited the right to withdraw only at the beginning of the process. Enditem
