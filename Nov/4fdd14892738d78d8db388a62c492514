 NAIROBI, Nov. 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese vlogger Wang Yao, an expatriate in Kenya, has become a hit on Douyin, the Chinese version of Tik Tok, for diversified and entertaining Sino-African stories he has been telling in the past 15 months together with his African super-model assistants. From farms, restaurants, shops to smartphones, excavators and handicrafts in Kenya, Rwanda and neighbouring countries, Wang has displayed a prospering Africa that is different from the stereotypes which portray the region as backward and disastrous.
