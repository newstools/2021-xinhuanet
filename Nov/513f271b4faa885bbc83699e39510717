The blast occurred during the rush hours in the morning near a wedding hall in Kot-e-Sangi locality in Police District 5 in western Kabul, eyewitness Mohammad Nabi told Xinhua. "The nature of the blast was presumably a sticky bomb attack and the explosion occurred when the Taliban vehicle was passing by," he said. It was not immediately known if any Taliban member aboard the vehicle was affected in the incident. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack yet. Kabul has witnessed a series of terror attacks by militants affiliated with Islamic State (IS) against the Afghan caretaker government since Taliban's takeover of the country in mid August. On Saturday, a journalist was killed and four people were wounded when a sticky bomb attached to a public minibus exploded in western Kabul.
