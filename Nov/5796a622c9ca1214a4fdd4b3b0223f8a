 BEIJING, Nov. 17 (Xinhua) -- Zhu Junfei is a native Beijing girl. She first saw someone playing ice hockey when she was five years old and fell in love with the sport right away. But at the time,  Junfei could only train and play with the boys because there were few girls playing ice hockey in Beijing. Junfei later joined the Shijia elementary school ice hockey team and quickly rose to prominence. From 2013 to 2017, she led the team to five consecutive Group A championships in the Beijing Primary and Secondary School Ice Hockey League. She then traveled overseas in search of better ice hockey training. Despite some initial setbacks, she was finally recognized for her performance and hard effort by the local team. Junfei has competed in numerous international tournaments with the Chinese women's national under-18 ice hockey team (U18) since 2018. Her greatest dream is to represent China in the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. She has been working hard for this objective and is ready to fight for the glory of the motherland.■
