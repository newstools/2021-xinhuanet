 It is officially announced that China's first air film insulation cross-country skiing track has achieved year-round snow after normal summer and autumn operations this year. With a total investment of 50 million yuan, the construction started in June 2020 and was put into trial operation in March this year. The skeleton of the construction is supported by steel structure keels, adopting double-layer thermal insulation film and equipped with surface refrigeration and ventilation system. In the non-snow season, even in summer, this track can guarantee snow training for Chinese athletes to prepare for the Winter Olympics. It is called "Land Snow Cave" for its cave-like outline.
