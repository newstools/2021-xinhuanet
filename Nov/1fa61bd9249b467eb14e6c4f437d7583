TEHRAN, Nov. 20 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian has condemned Britain's decision to declare the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) a terrorist organization. "The political solution for Palestine lies in a referendum among the indigenous residents (Muslim, Jewish, and Christian)," Abdollahian wrote in a tweet shortly before midnight on Friday. "The rights of Palestinians cannot be trampled by distorting facts," he said. On Friday, British Interior Minister Priti Patel issued a statement saying she had "acted to proscribe Hamas in its entirety" under Britain's Terrorism Act. London has listed the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, as a terrorist organization since 2000. Enditem
