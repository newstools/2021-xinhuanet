AMMAN, Nov. 26 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Jordanians on Friday took to the streets in downtown Amman, protesting the signing of declaration of intent for an energy-water project with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Israel on Monday. The protesters called on the government to repeal the cooperation deal as well as the Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty, urging the government to seek other water supply sources. During the same day, similar demonstrations were witnessed in several other Jordanian cities, where protesters said the cooperation would harm the kingdom's sovereignty. Jordan's Ministry of Water and Irrigation revealed Tuesday the declaration of intent, noting that it requires negotiating the feasibility of the establishment of a renewable energy project in Jordan to be implemented by a UAE company, in addition to a water desalination project to supply Jordan with 200 million cubic meters of water from the Mediterranean.
