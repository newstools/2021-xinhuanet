The center, located in the Yanqing competition zone, is set to host the Alpine skiing competitions at Beijing 2022.

Around 90 percent of the snow used at the Alpine skiing venue for the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympics was reportedly artificial, while artificial snow was also a feature of Vancouver 2010 and Sochi 2014. The center is the first Olympic-standard Alpine ski venue in China with a maximum vertical drop of about 900 meters. It has seven slopes.
