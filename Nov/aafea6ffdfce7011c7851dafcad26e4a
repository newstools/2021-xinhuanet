BEIJING, Nov. 30 (Xinhua) -- Most of the new locally-transmitted COVID-19 cases in China in November were reported in border regions, said a Chinese health official Tuesday. China will stick to its epidemic prevention and control policy, which aims to curb the transmission of the virus from abroad and prevent the epidemic from resurging in the country at the same time, said Mi Feng, a spokesperson for the National Health Commission at a press conference. He added that this is intended to minimize the epidemic's impact on the economy and society. Mi also noted that the country will accelerate the vaccination of elderly citizens and minors aged 3 to 17. With regard of guarding against inbound transmission of the virus, local authorities ought to establish a mechanism that enables all relevant parties, including airports and customs, to take coordinated steps, said Cui Gang, an official with NHC's disease control department. Cui noted that the situation of the pandemic abroad should be monitored, and relevant border regions need to update their epidemic prevention measures accordingly. International travelers entering China should follow the country's epidemic prevention protocols and undergo nucleic acid testing, quarantine and health monitoring, among other procedures, said Cui. Cui also emphasized the need to prevent the virus from transmitting via imported frozen food, urging relevant city authorities and enterprises to take up the necessary responsibilities. Enditem
