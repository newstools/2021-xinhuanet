KUNMING, Nov. 3 (Xinhua) -- London-based premium spirits maker Diageo has started building its first malt whisky distillery in China. With a planned investment of 75 million U.S. dollars, the project broke ground on Tuesday in Eryuan County, southwest China's Yunnan Province. China is the world's largest beverage alcohol market. The demand for whisky is growing rapidly among middle-class consumers keen to discover further and enjoy fine whiskies, prompting the company to set up a distillery here, said Sam Fischer, president of Diageo Asia Pacific and Global Travel. Located at an altitude of more than 2,100 meters, the site of the 66,000-square-meter distillery was selected for its mild climate and access to natural spring water. The site will feature an immersive and interactive visitor center that will attract whisky lovers and boost the local cultural tourism industry. Also, renewable and clean technologies will be adopted in the project. "The natural surroundings and the Eryuan landscape will allow us to craft a world-class, China-origin, single malt whisky that will capture the imagination of premium whisky lovers in China," Fischer said.
