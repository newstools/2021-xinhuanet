 Hong Kong's historic Central Market has regained vitality as a three-year conservation and revitalization project was completed in August this year.  The market, which was closed in 2003, boasts a long history of some 180 years.  By preserving some of its old features, the re-opened market provides locals with retrospective feelings in modern-day life.  The revamped market is now a shopping and dining space, with 13 original stalls preserved to showcase the architectural structure of the old building.  Produced by Xinhua Global Service
