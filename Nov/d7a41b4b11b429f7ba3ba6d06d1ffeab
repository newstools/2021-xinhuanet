BEIRUT, Nov. 1 (Xinhua) -- DHL, the global logistics service provider, said on Monday that it has received instructions from Saudi Arabia to halt all posts from Lebanon to the kingdom, Annahar local newspaper reported. The company told the local publication that it is now in the process of returning the posts, that it received on Saturday to be transported to Saudi Arabia, to clients in Lebanon. The instructions came after Saudi Arabia's decision to take escalatory measures against Lebanon in light of the comments by Lebanese Information Minister George Kordahi criticizing the Saudi Arabia-led coalition's war in Yemen. Saudi Arabia also banned all imports from Lebanon and expelled the Lebanese ambassador from the kingdom. The escalation comes at a time when Lebanon is suffering from its worst economic and financial crisis in its history. Enditem
