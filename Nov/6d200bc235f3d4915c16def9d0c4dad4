JERUSALEM, Nov. 8 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli military announced on Monday that it had downed a drone "allegedly belonging to the Hamas militant organization." Israel's Iron Dome air defense system intercepted the unarmed aerial vehicle (UAV), which was downed off the coast of the Gaza Strip after being monitored, said a statement released by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). "The IDF will continue to protect Israel's airspace and its civilians," read the statement. Last week, Israel's Defense Ministry announced it will deploy an advanced aerial surveillance balloon to boost its air defense capabilities. The system will be used after further testing and added to an already diverse array of mechanisms the IDF has for aerial defense. Hamas controls the Gaza Strip, which is under a blockade enforced by Israel. Enditem
