 China's e-commerce platforms are trying to make the upcoming Singles' Day shopping festival "greener." Alibaba's e-commerce platform Tmall will issue 100 million yuan (15.64 million U.S. dollars) of green vouchers, encouraging consumers to buy energy-efficient home appliances and products with "green" certification to support China's carbon reduction goals. JD.com has also joined the "low carbon" actions, developing recycling packaging, deploying new-energy logistics cargo vans and using photovoltaic power generation in warehousing. Cainiao Network, Alibaba's logistics arm, uses big data and artificial intelligence to reduce overpackaging. Its 60,000 courier stations are encouraging 100 million consumers to recycle and reuse parcel boxes. The Singles' Day shopping spree, first launched by Tmall on Nov. 11 in 2009, has now become one of the largest online shopping sprees worldwide. Produced by Xinhua Global Service
