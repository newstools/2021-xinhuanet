MOGADISHU, Nov. 4 (Xinhua) -- The Somali government on Thursday ordered a senior African Union peacekeeping mission (AMISOM) diplomat to leave the country within seven days. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation declared Simon Mulongo, deputy special representative of the chairperson of the African Union Commission for Somalia a "persona non-grata", saying the diplomat was engaging in activities outside the AU mission's mandate. "The individual listed (Mulongo) is designated 'persona non grata' and ordered to leave Somalia within seven days for engaging in activities incompatible with AMISOM's mandate and Somalia security strategy," the ministry said in a letter to the AU Commission. It was not clear what "in-compatible" activities Mulongo was engaged in that were not in line with the mission's mandate. Enditem
