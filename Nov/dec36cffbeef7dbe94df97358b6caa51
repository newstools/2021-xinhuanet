MOGADISHU, Nov. 17 (Xinhua) -- Somali security forces on Wednesday recovered several explosive devices during an ongoing security operation on the outskirts of the capital, Mogadishu. The Somali National Army (SNA) officials leading the operation told the SNA Radio that the devices including suicide belts and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) were seized during the operation at Elasha-Biyaha district, on the outskirts of the restive city. "The security forces have seized explosive devices including suicide belts and IEDs in a planned security operation at Elasha-Biyaha outskirts of Mogadishu on Wednesday," SNA Radio said. The recovery of the devices came two days after the Somali National Intelligence and Security Agency (NISA) rounded up the three terror suspects during an operation in the same district. The armed unit of NISA also seized landmines that al-Shabab militants were planning to use during their almost daily attacks on civilians and allied security forces. The latest security operation comes amid sustained operations by the Somali army against al-Shabab in the southern regions where the militants are still controlling the rural areas conducting ambushes and planting landmines.
