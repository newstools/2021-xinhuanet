 Chang'an China-Europe freight trains, which depart from or arrive in Xi'an, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, have made great progress in building an important channel for international trade, with its high efficiency and low cost. Launched in Nov. 2013, the freight train service has become a vital transport link to stabilize global supply chain, especially after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. It has also provided strong support for international anti-epidemic cooperation. In 2020, 56,000 tonnes of medical supplies were transported to Europe via the Chang'an trains. As of Nov. 20, Chang'an China-Europe freight trains had conducted 3,389 trips this year.  Produced by Xinhua Global Service
