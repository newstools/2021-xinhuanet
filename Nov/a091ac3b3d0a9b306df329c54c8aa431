TRIPOLI, Nov. 9 (Xinhua) -- Libyan Prime Minister Abdul-Hamid Dbeibah on Tuesday stressed the importance of telecommunications and information technology at an exhibition, in which Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE also participated. The ninth annual Technology Exhibition, which kicks off on Tuesday and will last for four days, aims to promote high-end technical exchanges in the telecommunications sector. The telecommunications sector "is a basic element in supporting development plans and helps build a diverse economy that is based on innovation and knowledge," said a statement issued by the government's information office. "Technology development is no longer an option, but a pressing need to develop all sectors of life, including national security and the wellbeing of the people," the prime minister said in the statement. The prime minister pledged to spare no efforts to support education and capacity building in the telecommunications sector. ZTE showcased the most advanced 5G products and solutions in the communication field at the exhibition. "We are demonstrating how we can accelerate the transformation with the arrival of 5G networks to Libya," Abdessattar Sassi, chief technical officer of ZTE Middle East Region, told Xinhua. "This is going to be one of the first countries in North Africa to have the 5G service, which is great news and a big contribution to the economic development in this country," Sassi said. Enditem
