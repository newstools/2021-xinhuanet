RIO DE JANEIRO, Nov. 3 (Xinhua) -- Chilean forward Eduardo Vargas scored a late winner as Atletico Mineiro extended their lead at the top of Brazil's Serie A standings with a 2-1 home win over Gremio on Wednesday. Matias Zaracho fired home a low finish in the 12th minute before Jaminton Campaz equalized just before the hour mark after combining with Miguel Borja. Vargas restored the hosts' lead by converting a 72nd-minute penalty after Campaz handled in the area. The result at Mineirao stadium means Atletico now have a 10-point lead over second-placed Palmeiras, with defending champions Flamengo two points further back. Gremio are 19th in the 20-team standings as they fight to avoid relegation to Serie B. Enditem
