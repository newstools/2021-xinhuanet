ADDIS ABABA, Nov. 3 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian federal government on Wednesday confirmed targeted airstrikes against rebel forces in the country's northernmost Tigray region. The Ethiopian air force "targeted Adi Bukray, a military training center for the terrorist group, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), located near Adi Hageray," the Ethiopian Government Communications Service said in a statement. It said large numbers of illegally recruited personnel were taking military training in the center. The confirmation followed the government's announcement on Tuesday of a nationwide state of emergency rule amid expanding conflict in the northern part of the country. The decision to impose emergency rule, made by the Ethiopian Council of Ministers, is expected to be endorsed by the Ethiopian House of People's Representatives (HoPR) in the coming days. Since the early hours of Nov. 4, 2020, the Ethiopian government has been undertaking military operations against the TPLF. In late June, the government announced a unilateral ceasefire in Tigray, but forces loyal to the TPLF soon took control of much of the area in the region, including the regional capital. The conflict has since expanded to Tigray's neighboring Amhara and Afar regions. The HoPR, the lower house of the Ethiopian parliament, has designated the TPLF as a terrorist organization. The Ethiopian government had previously assigned an interim administration in Tigray after the ouster of the TPLF, which used to rule the region. Enditem
