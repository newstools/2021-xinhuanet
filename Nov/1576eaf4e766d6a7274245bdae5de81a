VALLETTA, Nov. 19 (Xinhua) -- The online performance of "Yeh Shen," a Cinderella-like Chinese puppet show, is available since Friday during an international arts show hosted by Malta. The ZiguZajg International Arts Festival for Children and Young People will last until Nov. 29. The story of Yeh Shen originally appeared in a book that was written during China's Tang Dynasty (618-907 A.D.). The China National Theatre for Children (CNTC)'s puppet masters relate the story of a little girl named Yeh Shen, who remained kind and eager to help others even in adversity and finally harvested happiness. "Yeh Shen" is considered the earliest version of "Cinderella" in the world, Yang Xiaolong, director of the China Cultural Center in Malta, told Xinhua. This performance is just another example of the lively cultural exchanges between China and Malta, Yang said. It is also an attempt to broaden the scope of this cooperation by making a classic Chinese puppet show accessible to children all over the world. The CNTC performed "Three Monks," another Chinese classic, during the sixth edition of the ZiguZajg Festival in 2016. The festival, first held in 2011, has become a renowned annual cultural event that showcases outstanding plays from all over the world. Enditem
