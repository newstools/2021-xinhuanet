Ibrahim Farinloye, the coordinator of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) in the Lagos state, told Xinhua on the phone the 21-storey building under construction in the Ikoyi area of the Lagos city collapsed at about 3 p.m., local time, Monday, and so far four dead bodies have been recovered and four people been rescued alive. Farinloye said the emergency phase of search and rescue is ongoing with additional assistance from the Nigerian army and air force, and more people are feared trapped. He said what caused the collapse remains unclear and an investigation is underway.
