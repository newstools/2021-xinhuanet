BOGOTA, Nov. 19 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President Ivan Duque on Friday announced authorities captured 90 suspected members of the Clan del Golfo (Gulf Clan) criminal organization in a nationwide dragnet. "More than 300 uniformed members of the criminal investigation service carried out the mega operation 'Demolisher' in seven departments of the country," dealing a heavy blow to the group, Duque said via Twitter. "In simultaneous operations led by our #Public Force ... 90 alleged members of subgroups of the 'Clan del Golfo' were captured," added Duque. The operations were carried out in the departments of Antioquia, Atlantico, Cordoba, Bolivar, Choco, Cesar and Magdalena. On Oct. 23, Colombian authorities captured the top leader of the Gulf Clan, Dairo Antonio Usuga, alias "Otoniel," for whom they offered 795,000 U.S. dollars for his capture. His arrest marked the most important blow to drug trafficking this century, according to Duque. Enditem
