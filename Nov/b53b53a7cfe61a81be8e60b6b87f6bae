 Sunday marks the Cantonese Opera Day, which was initiated in 2003 in southeast China. In order to better promote the opera, artists have visited schools in Guangdong Province to give students lectures. The concept of a Cantonese Opera Day came from a conference held in 2002, with members of cultural divisions from Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao keen to provide an opportunity for people to appreciate the art of Cantonese Opera.
