NAIROBI, Nov. 4 (Xinhua) -- Kenya plans to put in place a livestock tracing system that uses electronic ear tags and microchips to boost exports, a government official said on Thursday. Lawrence Omuhaka, chief administrative secretary of Kenya's Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Cooperatives, said that the traceability system will be achieved by capturing data along the animal value chains including feedlots, quarantine facilities, slaughter facilities, processing facilities and markets. "The objective is to give assurance to overseas buyers that the Kenyan livestock is free from diseases," Omuhaka said. According to the ministry of agriculture, Kenya's traceability system will use the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)'s guidelines. The Kenyan government will subsidize the cost of acquisition of the tracing system in order to enhance access amongst livestock breeders. He added that the country's key export markets such as the European Union and the Middle East require that all exported livestock products are produced under traceability systems in order to guarantee food safety. The lack of a tracing system has curtailed Kenya's push to grow exports of livestock and products to international markets. Omuhaka revealed that the livestock sector plays an important role in the national economy of Kenya with a direct contribution of about 12 percent to the national gross domestic product. Enditem
