MEXICO CITY, Nov. 8 (Xinhua) -- Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Monday called for schools to fully reopen, given the decline in COVID-19 cases in the Latin American country. Students' gradual return to the classroom, which began in September, has not led to an upturn in COVID-19 cases, Lopez Obrador pointed out during his daily press conference. "There should no longer be any closed schools," Lopez Obrador told journalists at the National Palace in Mexico City, adding "school is a second home." Mexican schools began to reopen in September, though some reopened partially, with a hybrid model of both in-person and online classes. In-person classes were initially suspended at the end of February 2020, after the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak in the country. Enditem
