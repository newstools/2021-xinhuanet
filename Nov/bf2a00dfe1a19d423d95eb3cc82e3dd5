  The Guxiangdao - or Ancient Alleyway - Cafe in Kashgar, Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, has gained popularity on the internet as a must-visit attraction in the city. Its owner, Abdumijit Abdurixit, said it also offers Uygur people’s herbal tea, as well as various fresh juices, nuts and ice cream. Like him, many locals have involved themselves in tourism-related businesses since the ancient city of Kashgar was approved as a 5A scenic site, the highest rating for China's tourist attractions, in 2015.
