 The fourth China International Import Expo (CIIE) is being held from Nov. 5 to 10 in Shanghai. This year, more than 20 New Zealand companies are showcasing their products at the two New Zealand pavilions, "Taste New Zealand" and "Health New Zealand." In addition, big New Zealand brands have their stand-alone pavilions at the CIIE venue. Roy van den Hurk, general manager of Theland Global R&D at Milk New Zealand Dairy, is an "old friend" of the CIIE. His company has participated in the event four years in a row. More New Zealand companies are coming on board, attracted by CIIE's role in brand exposure and sales promotion. China has been New Zealand's top trading partner since 2017. The two countries upgraded their free trade agreement in January this year. According to the trade figures from Statistics NZ, from Jan. 1 to Oct. 20 this year, New Zealand exported 15.36 billion New Zealand dollars' (10.88 billion USD) worth of products to China, an increase of 26 percent from last year.
