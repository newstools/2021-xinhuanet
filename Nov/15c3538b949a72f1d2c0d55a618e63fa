BEIJING, Nov. 5 (Xinhua) -- China-Canada economic and trade relations are mutually beneficial by nature, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said Friday. Wang made the remarks at a daily news briefing in response to a query regarding two reports released by the Canada-China Business Council (CCBC). The two reports, namely "China's Economic Impact on Canada: Trade, Investment, and Migration" and the 2020/2021 Canada-China Business Survey, indicated that Canada's economic development closely links to China's, and the economic relationship between the two countries is bonded and brings opportunity for the development of bilateral relations. Wang said that according to the reports, nearly 70 percent of the Canadian companies surveyed listed China as the top or top 5 target market in their global development strategy. More than half of the Canadian companies surveyed plan to expand business in China, and 49 percent of Canadian companies are still making profits in China despite the impact of the pandemic. These figures reflect the confidence and expectation of the Canadian business community in China's economic prospects and business environment, said Wang. Wang added that the results also demonstrate the resilience and potential of China-Canada economic and trade cooperation. Wang said the facts have fully demonstrated that the essence of China-Canada economic and trade cooperation is mutually beneficial and has brought tangible benefits to the two peoples. "We welcome Canadian investors to invest and do businesses in China," said Wang. He added that ideally, Canada would meet China halfway to create a constructive political atmosphere for economic and trade cooperation. Canada could also provide a fair, just, open, and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese enterprises. Enditem
