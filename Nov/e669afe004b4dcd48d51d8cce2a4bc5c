 In a Chinese fable, an old man's determination to move the mountains touched the heavens so deeply that he sent two titans to help him out. Today, a similar story happened, but instead of the mountains, the gigantic task is a 1.5 km road that took 15 years to build. Produced by Xinhua Global Service■
