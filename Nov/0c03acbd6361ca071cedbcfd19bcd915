GAZA, Nov. 7 (Xinhua) -- An official of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) said Saturday that the agency's financial situation is "extremely dangerous." The UN agency suffers a deficit of more than 100 million U.S. dollars for such services as the salaries of 28,000 UNRWA employees in its five areas of operation, Adnan Abu Hasna, the media advisor of UNRWA in Gaza, told reporters. "The agency has made great efforts to find solutions to the crisis, but the situation seems difficult so far," Abu Hasna said, noting that an international donors' conference will be held on Nov. 16 to discuss the issue. "I hope that the conference will succeed with a new vision for UNRWA's funding and its sustainability," he added. UNRWA was established by the UN General Assembly in 1949 with a mandate to provide assistance and protection to some 5.6 million Palestinian refugees with education, health care, relief and social services.
