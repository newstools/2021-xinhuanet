 HEFEI, Nov. 30 (Xinhua) -- The coal-rich city of Huaibei in Anhui Province is one of the main energy providers in east China. However, the excessive coal exploitation had led to vast subsidence areas. In recent years, the city has enhanced ecological management and made unremitting efforts to repair and restore coal mining subsidence areas. The ecologically restored areas are now a good option for locals to relax.  Aerial photo taken on Nov. 25, 2021 shows a wetland park in Huaibei City, east China's Anhui Province.
