BEIJING, Nov. 5 (Xinhua) -- China's Shenzhou-13 astronauts will conduct extravehicular activities (EVAs) for the first time in the next few days, announced the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) on Friday. Three Chinese astronauts have been working and living in orbit for 21 days since they were sent into space onboard the Shenzhou-13 spaceship and entered the combination of the country's space station on Oct. 16, said the agency. The three astronauts are currently in good condition, and the combination is operating stably. All conditions for the crew's first EVAs are in place, the CMSA said. The combination of China's space station is formed by the Shenzhou-13 spaceship, Tianhe core module, and cargo crafts Tianzhou-2 and Tianzhou-3. Enditem
