BOGOTA, Nov. 7 (Xinhua) -- At least four Colombian soldiers were killed in an ambush carried out by members of the Gulf Clan near the municipality of Ituango, Antioquia department, the Ministry of National Defense confirmed on Sunday. The commander of the Army's Seventh Division, General Juvenal Diaz, explained that members of the criminal group fired on and threw grenades inside a house where military personnel were carrying out surveillance in the area. He said the attack was in retaliation for the recent capture of the leader of the Gulf Clan, Dairo Antonio Usuga, alias "Otoniel." Colombian authorities reported Otoniel's capture on Oct. 23 following the offer of a reward of about 800,000 U.S. dollars. The capture of Otoniel is the most important blow to drug trafficking in Colombia this century, according to President Ivan Duque. Enditem
