 China's green action initiatives that encourage green infrastructure, energy, transportation and finance under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) framework are contributing to the global fight against climate change, a British expert has said.  Antony Froggatt, deputy director of Environment and Society Programme Chatham House, a London-based think tank, made the remarks in Glasgow, Scotland, where the 26th United Nations Conference of Parties on Climate Change (COP26) is underway.  In 2020, 57 percent of China's investment in BRI partner countries went to renewable energy projects, up from 38 percent in 2019.  As the world's largest developing country that has yet to finalize industrialization, China has announced that it will strive to peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, a move which Froggatt said "surprised many but welcomed by everyone."  The expert hailed China's efforts to develop green technology while building infrastructure and lifting about 100 million people out of extreme poverty over the past nine years.  China has become the world's largest market for renewable energy, with renewable power accounting for 29.5 percent of overall electricity consumption, according to official statistics.  The country is also the world's biggest manufacturer of renewable energy equipment, ranking first in installed capacity of hydroelectric, wind and solar power generation, and has the largest nuclear power generating projects under construction.
