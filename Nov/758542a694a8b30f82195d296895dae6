JERUSALEM, Nov. 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Isaac Herzog flew on Sunday for an official visit to London that will include meetings with Prince Charles and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Herzog will also meet with British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, lawmakers and leaders of the Jewish community, according to a statement issued on his behalf. Ahead of his departure, Herzog said he will talk with the British side on the Iran nuclear issue. Herzog also said he will also thank Johnson for the recent decision by the British government to recognize the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) as "a terrorist organization." Palestine on Saturday rejected Britain's decision to designate Hamas as a terrorist group, calling it an unjustified attack on the Palestinian people. This is Herzog's first official trip to Britain since he was sworn in as president in July. Enditem
