 Photo taken on Nov. 3, 2021 shows a flock of migratory birds flying over Momoge Wetland in Zhenlai County, Baicheng City, northeast China's Jilin Province. As the temperature gradually decreases, migratory birds in Momoge National Nature Reserve are moving south. In recent years, Baicheng City has implemented ecological projects such as connecting rivers and lakes and the ecological environment has been improving, attracting hundreds of thousands of migratory birds including white cranes, wild geese and wild ducks. The birds fly to Momoge Wetland in spring when it's getting warm and fly to the south in autumn when it's getting cold. (Xinhua/Zhang Nan)
