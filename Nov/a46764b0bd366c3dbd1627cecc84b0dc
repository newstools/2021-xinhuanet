DAMASCUS, Nov. 8 (Xinhua) -- Syria's air defenses on Monday evening responded to an Israeli attack targeting areas on the Syrian coast and the central province of Homs, state news agency SANA reported. The attack targeted Homs and the coastal area near the Tartus governorate in northwestern Syria, the report said, adding that it caused damage and two soldiers were wounded. People have heard the explosions as the air defenses were tracing the Israeli missiles. The report said the air defenses intercepted most of the missiles which were firing from inside the Lebanese airspace. It is the latest one in a string of Israeli attacks targeting military sites in Syria. Usually, Israel claims that it targets Iranian positions or weapons in Syria. The last Israeli attack targeted military sites in the capital Damascus on Oct. 30. Enditem
