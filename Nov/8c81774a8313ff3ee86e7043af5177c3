SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 16 (Xinhua) -- Boeing on Tuesday announced that Indian carrier Akasa Air has ordered 72 737 MAX airplanes to build its fleet. Valued at nearly 9 billion U.S. dollars at list prices, Akasa Air's order includes two variants from the 737 MAX family, the 737-8 and the 737-8-200, the announcement said. India's growing economy and expanding middle class will fuel strong demand for commercial flights, driving the need for more than 2,200 new airplanes in South Asia valued at nearly 320 billion U.S. dollars over the next 20 years, according to Boeing's 2021 Commercial Market Outlook forecast.
