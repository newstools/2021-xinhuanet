 XIAMEN, Nov. 2 (Xinhua) -- People are often fascinated by the performance of a mermaid, but they don't always realize that it's not easy to be a professional one. With years of diving experience, You Yijin began to be a mermaid performer at the Ocean Science Park in Xiamen, east China's Fujian Province, earlier this year. You's show turns very popular and has won her many fans. Her videos went viral on the Internet. You is familiar with the underwater environment, but playing a mermaid is much more difficult than normal diving. She hopes to show her audience the harmony between humans and the ocean in a multi-dimensional way, and attract more people to ocean-related sports. Produced by Xinhua Global Service
