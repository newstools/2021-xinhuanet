--> Bamboo drifting requires great strength and balance. It was included in the national intangible cultural heritage list in July 2021. Yang Liu, 24, has been learning the art, which is known as a kind of kung fu, since she was only 7. Now Yang Liu always dresses in ancient Han style costume, performing bamboo drifting and dancing. Her video has attracted millions of subscribers from all over the world. Video credit to "Yang Liu" (kuaishou#Yangliu955), posted on Chinese online video-sharing platform Kuaishou.
