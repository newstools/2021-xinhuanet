by Yosley Carrero HAVANA, Nov. 23 (Xinhua) -- The 4th World Media Summit is a platform for global media to work more closely against fake news amid a changing global scenario, a Cuban media executive has said. This event is essential in light of the common responsibilities and challenges that media organizations will face for the years to come, Luis Enrique Gonzalez, president of Cuban news agency Prensa Latina, told Xinhua in a recent interview. Coordinated efforts to combat misinformation and disinformation campaigns are more necessary than ever, he said. "News organizations are called to provide people with high-quality journalism at a time the media landscape is changing dramatically with the emergence of new technologies of information and communication," he said. Unfortunately, digital platforms and social networking sites are also used to irresponsibly spread rumors and biased news nowadays, said Gonzalez. "We are called to create a common front for the defense of truth, social responsibility and ethics in journalism," he said, noting that no country should use media organizations as a tool to interfere in the internal affairs of other nations. For Prensa Latina, he said, this year's media summit serves as a great opportunity to forge relations with media outlets from all over the world and get updated with trends dominating the current media landscape. "We should work together in reducing the technological gap between big and small media organizations, which has increased amid the COVID-19 pandemic," he said. Enditem
