JAKARTA, Nov. 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will start administer COVID-19 booster shots for the public after 50 percent of the population are fully vaccinated, Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin said Monday. "Booster vaccination is a sensitive issue related to equality. There are still countries that have not yet obtained access to COVID-19 vaccines," Sadikin said at a parliamentary hearing which was held in a hybrid way. As Indonesia has reached 39 percent of the current second doses of vaccines, Sadikin said that the booster would begin at the end of December, earlier than the initial plan to start in early 2022. The booster vaccines will be prioritized for the elderly with a higher mortality rate and will then be given free of charge to the poor, while others have to pay for their jabs. The Indonesian government has extended its public mobility restrictions, locally known as PPKM, outside Java and Bali from Nov. 9 to Nov. 22, as the transmission has decreased up to 97.5 percent compared to the peak of the second wave of coronavirus infection in July. Meanwhile, the restrictions in Java and Bali have been extended until Nov. 15. Enditem
