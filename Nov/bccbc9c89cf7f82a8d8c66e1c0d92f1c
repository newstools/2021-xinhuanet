HARARE, Nov. 25 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube presented on Thursday the 2022 national budget in parliament and projected a 5.5 percent growth rate next year. The growth rate for 2022 is predicted based on the 7.8 percent increase envisaged this year, thanks to a good agricultural season, higher international mineral commodity prices and robust containment measures against the COVID-19 pandemic. Ncube said the 2022 growth projection is, however, subject to risks relating to the pandemic and its impact on key sectors of the economy. A prudent fiscal policy complemented by tight monetary policy will be pursued under the 2022 budget, said Ncube. Enditem
