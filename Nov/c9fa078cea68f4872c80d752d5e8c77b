NEW YORK, Nov. 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. oil prices declined Wednesday on an unexpected rise of U.S. commercial crude oil inventories in the previous week and profit-taking a day ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. U.S. commercial crude oil inventory increased by 1 million barrels in the week ending Nov. 19 in contrast with market expectation of a draw, according to data issued by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday. Total motor gasoline inventories and distillate fuel inventories fell 600,000 barrels and 2 million barrels in the week, respectively, according to EIA. U.S. commercial crude oil inventories dropped 1.3 million barrels within the week, according to a survey of analysts by S&P Global Platts. The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for January delivery decreased by 0.11 U.S. dollar to settle at 78.39 dollars a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Oil price is most likely very close to the low for the year, according to Phil Flynn, senior market analyst with the Price Futures Group. "It successfully held key support below 75 U.S. dollars per barrel and that level should hold and be strong support from here on out. The main risk to that bottom continues to be a large COVID shutdown or some other financial black swan event," said Flynn on Wednesday. Enditem
