CHANGCHUN, Nov. 21 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists in northeast China's Jilin Province have discovered several ruins of the ancient Fuyu Kingdom in the Yong'an Site in the city of Jilin, according to the provincial cultural relics and archaeology research institute. The Yong'an Site is located in Fengman District of Jilin City. Archaeologists first found the site in 2018. So far, 1,000 square meters of the site have been excavated, said Wang Cong, head of the archaeological team at the site. Archaeologists also found decorative bricks, tiles and other architectural components and pottery shards as well as the remains of two houses and a well belonging to different ancient periods in the site. "The discovery of the well proves that the ancient people living in the area had a history of drilling and using wells no later than the period of the Bohai Kingdom (698-926)," Wang said. Through the excavation of the well, archeologists restored the well drilling technology in this historical period. "The excavated well is 7 meters deep," Wang said. It is rare to find house ruins of Fuyu Kingdom which is an ethnic regime in northeast China from the 2nd century BC to AD 494. It indicates that Yong'an site is a residential ruin of the Fuyu Kingdom. It also provides new materials for further recovering the living scenes of Fuyu people and studying the surrounding remains of the same period, Wang said. Enditem
