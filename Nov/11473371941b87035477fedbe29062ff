MENDOZA, Nov. 4 (Xinhua) -- Luis Vazquez scored a second-half goal as Boca Junior progressed to the Copa Argentina final with a 1-0 home win over Argentinos Juniors on Wednesday. The 20-year-old forward slotted in a low shot at the far post after Carlos Zambrano met Sebastian Villa's diagonal free-kick with a flicked header. Boca will face the winners of the November 11 duel between Talleres Cordoba and Godoy Cruz in the final next month. The champions will automatically qualify for next year's Copa Libertadores, South America's premier club competition. Boca are aiming to win the Copa Argentina for a record fourth time, having previously lifted the trophy in 1969, 2012 and 2015. Enditem
