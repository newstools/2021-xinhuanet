This was the highest single-day count in the country for the second day in a row. The institute said that 44.4 percent of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests came back positive, down from 44.8 percent a day earlier. Nine people died from COVID-19, taking the cumulative death toll in the country of some 2.1 million citizens to 5,111. The government is expected to discuss further measures against the spread of coronavirus on Friday. Currently, only those who have been fully vaccinated, tested negative or recovered from the virus are allowed to enter most public institutions. In the past few days, several hospitals cut their non-urgent programs to enable them to serve COVID-19 patients, whose number increased by 65 to 735 on Wednesday. To date, 53.2 percent of Slovenia's population has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Enditem
