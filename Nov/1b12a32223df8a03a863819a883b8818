 At least 15 people have been killed and several others wounded in a terrorist attack on a military hospital in Kabul on Tuesday, a local TV channel reported. "At least 15 people, all security personnel of the Islamic Emirate, have been killed and numerous others injured following the terrorist attack on the 400-bed hospital," 1TV reported in its news bulletin. One of the attackers had been killed and cleanup operation was going on to eliminate the second attacker who remained inside the hospital, the media outlet reported. A bomb blast rocked near the military hospital in Kabul at around 1:00 p.m. local time followed by gunshots, said spokesman for the Interior Ministry Qari Sayed Khost, who didn't provide more details. The 400-bed military hospital in the Police District 10 of Kabul is the main army hospital in Afghanistan that provides medical treatments to military personnel and their families. Locals close to the site said that two explosions hit the area followed by gunshots, and ambulances began taking out bodies and those wounded to health centers. The number of casualties, according to locals who declined to be identified, is higher than that reported by the media. No group has claimed responsibility for the deadly attack. However, the hardliner Islamic State group has in the past claimed such attacks in Afghanistan.  Produced by Xinhua Global Service
