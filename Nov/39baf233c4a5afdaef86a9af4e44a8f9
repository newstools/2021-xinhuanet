 China's Shenzhou-13 taikonauts said they feel well during their extravehicular activities (EVAs). Taikonauts Zhai Zhigang and Wang Yaping have been out of China's space station core module Tianhe by 8:28 p.m. (Beijing Time) Sunday to start EVAs, the China Manned Space Agency said. Donning China-developed new-generation Feitian spacesuits, the pair are conducting a series of extravehicular tasks with the aid of the mechanical arm. Ye Guangfu stayed inside to support his crewmates in completing the operations. Wang's EVAs make her the country's first female astronaut to leave footprints in outer space. China launched the Shenzhou-13 spaceship on Oct. 16, sending the three astronauts on a six-month mission to construct its space station.  Produced by Xinhua Global Service
