 ANHUI, Nov. 13 (Xinhua) --Climbing and walking over 100 meters high, the power transmission construction workers are known as "spider man". They are working around the clock to ensure that a critical project connecting west and east China gets completed on time. With a total length of 2,087 kilometers, the "Baihetan-Jiangsu" ultra-high-voltage (UHV) power transmission project is one of China's "power highways". It transmits electricity from the country's hydro-resource-rich west to the more developed, power-hungry east. By the time of its operation in 2022, the project will be capable of transmitting 31.2 billion kWh per year, which will reduce 14 million tonnes of coal for power generation in east China.
