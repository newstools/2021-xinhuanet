 As the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics is less than 3 months away, youngsters in Shenyang, the capital city of northeast China's Liaoning Province are eager to enjoy the passion of winter sports. Young athletes gathered in rugby pitches for the "2021 Shenyang City University Snow Rugby Club League". Snow rugby is commonly played in wintery conditions, particularly deep snow. Unlike the traditional rugby, the snow rugby is played on a small field covered in snow, each team is made of 5 players, and there are rolling substitutions which means players can switch off and on.
