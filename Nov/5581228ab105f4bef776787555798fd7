ZAGREB, Nov. 10 (Xinhua) -- Gabrijela Zalac, Croatia's former minister of regional development and EU funds, and Tomislav Petric, director of the Central Finance and Contracting Agency (SAFU), as well as two other persons were arrested on Wednesday by the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) on suspicion of fraud. According to Croatian media reports, the four are suspected of crimes committed in the ministry and in the SAFU in connection with the public procurement of a software system from a private company in Croatia worth 16.2 million Croatian kuna (2.5 million U.S. dollars) in 2018. The country's Prime Minister, Andrej Plenkovic, said he was surprised by the arrest and would not comment on it. Zalac served in Plenkovic's government between October 2016 and July 2019, when she was replaced in a reshuffle. Plenkovic rejected Zalac's resignation after a traffic incident in which she hit and injured a ten-year-old girl while driving with an expired driving license in 2019. Enditem
